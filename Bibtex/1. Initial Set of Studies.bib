Common belief and recent studies suggest that aspects are well-suited for implementing features. We evaluate the suitability of AspectJ with respect to this task by a case study that refactors the embedded database system Berkeley DB into 38 features. Contrary to our initial expectations, the results were not encouraging. As the number of aspects in a feature grows, there is a noticeable decrease in code readability and maintainability. Most of the unique and powerful features of AspectJ were not needed. We document where AspectJ is unsuitable for implementing features of refactored legacy applications and explain why. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {To achieve the maximum productivity using minimum resource is the aim of any software industry. Software engineering provides an abstraction process to develop software product. It has introduced various methodologies, principles and concepts. Most of them are the software process models which are also known as software life cycle models. In the software industry different-different types of projects (small, medium, large, complex) arrive in random inter arrival time for development of software products. Before implementing the products, project managers decide an appropriated software process model in documentation that is used in production of products. An empirical study conducted in 2012 that presents various effecting factors for selecting any software life cycle model. One of the important factors is team size. Software industry has a development team which works in co-ordination and depends on each other. Sometimes project managers are not intelligently assigned resources to particular phases of software life cycle model. Therefore to overcome these issues we are simulating iterative waterfall and incremental model to determine optimal resources for every phase of software life cycle model. This study shall enable the project manager to determine optimal resource without implementing software product. As future work, we shall be simulating spiral and iterative incremental model to determine which SDLC model is more appropriate for software industry.},

Evidence that relates software process to quality is often anecdotal or, when data is presented, it is to some extent contradictory or clashes with opposite evidence coming from different samples. Also, the influence of quality on software architecture is mostly described in a qualitative fashion based on architects expertise. Little contemporary data exists to document the actual perception from software experts in industry towards quality requirements for software products. Therefore, a comprehensive survey of software professionals was conducted to attempt to discover these practices. In this paper, we present a view of the captured data from this survey with a focus on investigating the influence of quality requirements on the software architectural decisions in practice.},

  abstract  = {The increasing presence of mobile devices in the society has motivated the use of these gadgets in several segments. This reality has contributed to the emergence of a new and innovative modality of learning - the mobile learning, or simply, m-learning. In short, mobile learning is based on the use of a set of specific mobile applications, which possesses similar features and specific characteristics according to the learning goals. In a different but related perspective, the emerging reuse technique of Software Product Line (SPL) allows mass customization and systematic derivation of products, such as mobile learning applications. Motivated by this scenario, we have worked on the establishment of M-SPLearning, a SPL to the mobile learning applications domain. M-SPLearning has been developed throughout a proactive adoption model, according to the basics of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). In this paper, we discuss the main aspects of the development of M-SPLearning, focusing on the implementation phase. Also, as a case study, we illustrate two products generated by the SPL proposed. The main results obtained suggest the practical feasibility of adopting M-SPLearning in the development of mobile learning applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Getting a proper set of reusable requirements is an important milestone for successful software product line (SPL) practice. But modeling SPL requirements is usually more complex and difficult than modeling requirements for individual applications because it often involves systematically exploring commonality and variation across a set of applications. This paper presents a feature-oriented approach to modeling and reusing SPL requirements. A framework of the feature model is first proposed from five aspects, namely, basic structure, variation representation mechanism, variation binding time, variation constraint mechanism and quality feature analysis. Then, a customization-based reusing method is suggested, and a feature-oriented domain modeling method (FODM) is presented, including a concrete form of the feature model and a modeling process for it. At the end, a case study of a real domain is used to validate the feature model framework and demonstrate FODM.},

The main strategies to build the software product line are based on the domain commonality and variability, the incremental scope and the use of existing artifacts. It consists on a lean methodology with little impact on the organization, suitable for small projects, which reduces product line start-up time. Software Product Lines focuses on creating a family of products instead of individual products. This approach has spectacular benefits on reducing the time to market, maintaining the know-how, reducing the development costs and increasing the quality of new products. The maintenance of the products is also enhanced since all the data acquisition systems share the same product line architecture.},

  abstract  = {The domain-specific model-driven development requires effective and flexible techniques for implementing domain-specific rule generators. In this paper, we present a framework for rule generation through model translation with feature model, a high-level of the domain model to translate into low-level of rule language based on the paradigm of software reuse in terms of customisation and configuration with domain-specific rule strategies benefit mode-to-text translations. This framework is domain-specific where non-technical domain user can customise and configure the business process models. These compositions support two dimensional of translation modularity by using software product line engineering. The domain engineering is achieved by designing the domain and process model as a requirement space, it is also called template model, connecting with feature model through weaving model. The feature model is a high-level input model to customise the template model to an implementation. The application engineering is achieved by supporting the rule definition and configuring the generated rules. We discuss the development approach of the framework in a domain-specific environment; we present a case study in a Digital Content Technology (DCT) domain.

  abstract  = {In order to continuously support the value delivery both in short-term and long-term, a key goal for large software companies is to continuously develop and manage software architecture. In order to understand how architecture management is employed in large Agile software companies, we have conducted interviews involving several roles at 5 firms. Through a combination of structured inductive and deductive analysis proper of Grounded Theory, we have identified current architect roles and gaps in the architecture practices in the studied organizations. From such investigation, we have developed an organizational framework, CAFFEA, for Agile architecting, including roles, (virtual) teams and practices. The framework has been evaluated through a cross-company workshop including participants from 5 large software companies, discussion groups and a final survey. Finally, we have evaluated the framework in practice after one year of its application at one of the companies. We found that some necessary architectural practices are overlooked in Large Agile Software Development. The evaluation of CAFFEA framework showed that the included roles and teams are needed in order to mitigate the gaps in the architectural practices. The responsibilities and the activities have been mapped to key architect roles compatible with the Scrum setting employed at the companies. The evaluation of CAFFEA shows key benefits. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Diverse development methodologies use the feature model (FM) to represent common and variable features of a software product line (SPL). This model has also been used to derive products for testing. However, the test of all combinations of features (products) is infeasible in practice, due to the growing complexity of the applications, and only a subset of products is usually selected. Existing selection methods do not consider faults in the FM. The application of a fault-based approach can increase the probability of finding faults and the confidence that the SPL products match the requirements. Considering that, this paper introduces a mutation based approach to help in the selection of products for feature testing of SPLs. Mutation operators are introduced and a testing process is also proposed. Results from a case study are reported, and a comparison with pair-wise testing shows that other kind of faults can be revealed by the introduced approach.

Companies and organizations have opened up their platforms and artifacts to others, including partners and third-part developers around the world. This changes the traditional software industry because it requires mature research in software architecture, component-based software engineering and software product line in a market and business environment. In this sense, this paper presents an initial proposal for SECOs engineering in order to outline a set of steps that combines three different dimensions of SECOs and joins different perspectives in SECOs research literature through a survey. In this paper, the focus is on the first dimension, that is, architecture. A preliminary analysis done by the Brazilian Software Reuse Lab's SECOs at COPPE/UFRJ points out that several concepts presented at IWSECO 2009 and IWSECO 2010 can be connected in a broader SE approach.},

However, due to the lack of binding representation in feature model, most of them rely on other build systems for variability resolution to produce product implementations. The disconnection incurs redundant efforts by requiring developers to make or manage two separate artifacts, a variability model and an instantiation script. As a solution for this problem, we previously proposed a software binding application tool, SBAT, which supports build systems and is based on the orthogonal variability description language (OVDL) that simply and strictly defines syntaxes for variability modeling and variability resolution. By using this tool, developers can reduce efforts in writing and managing a script for variability modeling and variability resolution. In this paper, we suggest enhanced version of SBAT that adopts the new improved version of OVDL and conduct a practical case study to demonstrate the efforts reduction effect in writing and modifying scripts that can be achieved when using SBAT. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

The main thrust of this tutorial is to unveil and uncover the potential of Software Engineering to address the above concerns from multiple dimensions. We briefly discuss the state-of-art in educational technologies (ET) from a software engineering (SE) perspective and formulate significant research challenges for both the communities. We emphasize that developing and maintaining educational technologies is not just content and infrastructure management but has tremendous scope to apply the ideas of software engineering. SE is further required to address the scale and variety challenges that are inherent in T4E domain. We discuss the applicability of SE life cycles (iterative, agile) in the context of T4E domain. We then present a case study of applying software engineering ideas to accelerate the development and maintenance of a family of eLearning Systems. Finally, we briefly outline an integrated approach of Lean, Agile and Software Product Lines (SPL) with potential research agenda for next 5-10 years and uncover this approach as a significant value add for the T4E community. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Furthermore, the development and configuration of these applications are difficult tasks that require expertise in diverse domains, including software engineering, control engineering, and computer vision. As a solution to these problems, this paper extends and integrates our previous works, which are based on two promising techniques: Cloud Robotics and Software Product Lines. Cloud Robotics provides a powerful and scalable environment to offload the computationally expensive algorithms resulting in low-cost processors and light-weight robots. Software Product Lines allow the end user to deploy and configure complex robotics applications without dealing with low-level problems such as configuring algorithms and designing architectures. This paper discusses the proposed method in depth, and demonstrates its advantages with a case study. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

The frequent study of new research methodologies, the software diversity, simulators and data involved in experiments, lead to the necessity of environments that provide facilities for technology use and matching. Aiming to support the software diversity, the proposed solution is a scientific workflow environment that allows the researchers to create their own personalized workflows, using components provided by the development team as well as developed by themselves, regardless of the language being used. The basis for this environment is a component based software product line. The proposed extractive method for the product line development is supported by a software reengineering framework and uses existing modeling techniques. One case study was performed to evaluate some aspects, including the components reuse enhancement and the workflow customization capability. This study case had a positive result, showing that the proposed solution allows the researchers to customize their workflows.},

Education has a key role to support the next generation of engineers to build highly complex SPLs. Yet, it is unclear how SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, or what is the material available. In this paper, we carry out a survey with over 30 respondents with the purpose of capturing a snapshot of the state of teaching in our community. We report and discuss quantitative as well as qualitative results of the survey. We build upon them and sketch six concrete actions to continue improving the state of practice of SPL teaching. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

However, a template that considers context awareness in SPL was not found, and thus, this paper proposes a use case template for a Context Aware SPL based on the results of a controlled experiment conducted with four of the use case templates for traditional SPL found in the literature. This paper also presents a preliminary evaluation of the proposed template.},

This paradigm has shown great acceptance in the corporate environment (Motorola, Nokia, and Hewlett Packard) to allow the construction of more efficiently through reusing common components applications, besides being extensively researched by academics. The segment of voice interface, in turn, came up with the demand for systems capable of interacting with users, but in the application development process for this domain there is a lack of tools that make the task more productively. The FIVE (Framework for an Integrated Voice Environment) is a development environment for Voice Interface products designed to increase productivity in this segment. This paper aims to apply a SPL approach to FIVE. For this, a comparative evaluation of the process of construction of FIVE and SPL platforms was performed. Then adjustments in order to correct structural problems and, finally, the framework was validated using a set of experiments which sought to ensure the confirmation of such changes have been made.

While they solve many of the current software development challenges, related literature claims that DSLs usually have a flaw: The high effort required to implement and use them. However, internal DSLs are developed with less effort because they are built on top of an existing programming language and can use the whole language infrastructure consisting of interpreter, compiler, or editors. This article presents an engineering process for internal DSLs. An agile process leads from analysis to design and implementation. Expressions and language capabilities are implemented using tests and a set of patterns, which provide reusable knowledge how to properly structure and design the DSL implementation. As a case study, we show how to implement a software product line configuration DSL using Ruby and Python as host languages. In summary, the proposed process and patterns facilitate the successful planning and developing of internal DSLs using dynamic programming languages as the host. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Despite its error-proneness and low abstraction level, the preprocessor is still widely used in present-day software projects to implement variable software. However, not much is known about how cpp is employed to implement variability. To address this issue, we have analyzed forty open-source software projects written in C. Specifically, we answer the following questions: How does program size influence variability? How complex are extensions made via cpp's variability mechanisms? At which level of granularity are extensions applied? Which types of extension occur? These questions revive earlier discussions on program comprehension and refactoring in the context of the preprocessor. To provide answers, we introduce several metrics measuring the variability, complexity, granularity, and types of extension applied by preprocessor directives. Based on the collected data, we suggest alternative implementation techniques. Our data set is a rich source for rethinking language design and tool support. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

  abstract  = {Software Product Lines (SPL) exploits reuse by identifying, modeling, and systemically reusing software features to develop different but related software systems. Successful reuse of a product line depends greatly on the modularity of the features that characterize the product line. Traditionally, features in SPL are grouped along the dimension of commonality and variability. However, this single-dimension grouping overlooks the crosscutting nature of some features in the system, which negatively impacts the reusability and modularity of the product line architecture. In this paper we address this particular problem by investigating the concept of Aspectual Feature (AF) as another grouping dimension thai can be used in SPLs. To this end, the paper proposes the Aspectual Product Line Engineering (APPLE) approach for identifying, modeling, and implementing AFs to enhance the reuse of SPLs. A tool support for implementing the APPLE approach is also presented and demonstrated through a case study.},

However, current approaches and research, while often addressing feature modeling and component variability, insufficiently address difficulties and additional complexity with respect to entity model variability, which negatively impacts various software qualities, such as correctness, reusability, maintainability, testability, and evolvability. This paper presents a solution approach with an integrated mechanism providing a consistent view to capture data variability in entity models, while hiding and decoupling components from superfluous data elements via adapter generation. An eHealth SPL case study is presented supporting adapter generation with differential entity conversion. The results show that with this approach, entity model variability can be effectively addressed and desirable software qualities preserved. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Despite the successes of software product lines (SPL), managing the evolution of a SPL remains difficult and error-prone. Our focus of evolution is on the concrete tasks integrators have to perform to update deployed SPL products, in particular products that require runtime updates with minimal interruption. The complexity of updating a deployed SPL product is caused by multiple interdependent concerns, including variability, traceability, versioning, availability, and correctness. Existing approaches typically focus on particular concerns while making abstraction of others, thus offering only partial solutions. An integrated approach that takes into account the different stakeholder concerns is lacking. In this paper, we present an architectural approach for updating SPL products that supports multiple concerns. The approach comprises of two complementary parts: (1) an update viewpoint that defines the conventions for constructing and using architecture views to deal with multiple update concerns; and (2) a supporting framework that provides an extensible infrastructure supporting integrators of a SPL. We evaluated the approach for an industrial SPL for logistic systems providing empirical evidence for its benefits and recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Test case prioritization (TCP) attempts to order test cases such that those which are more important, according to some criterion or measurement, are executed earlier. TCP has been applied in many testing situations, including, for example, regression testing. An abstract test case (also called a model input) is an important type of test case, and has been widely used in practice, such as in configurable systems and software product lines. Similarity-based test case prioritization (STCP) has been proven to be cost-effective for abstract test cases (ATCs), but because there are many similarity measures which could be used to evaluate ATCs and to support STCP, we face the following question: How can we choose the similarity measure(s) for prioritizing ATCs that will deliver the most effective results? To address this, we studied fourteen measures and two popular STCP algorithms - local STCP (LSTCP), and global STCP (GSTCP). We also conducted an empirical study of five realworld programs, and investigated the efficacy of each similarity measure, according to the interaction coverage rate and fault detection rate. The results of these studies show that GSTCP outperforms LSTCP - in 61{\%} to 84{\%} of the cases, in terms of interaction coverage rates; and in 76{\%} to 78{\%} of the cases with respect to fault detection rates. Our studies also show that Overlap, the simplest similarity measure examined in this study, could obtain the overall best performance for LSTCP; and that Goodall3 has the best performance for GSTCP.},

We found that the ICBP category has better testing effectiveness than others, according to fault detection rates. Surprisingly, we found that NIGP can achieve similar performance to IMBP, and that SBP can sometimes achieve even better rates of fault detection than some ICBP techniques.},

  abstract  = {In the last decades, software product lines (SPL) have proven to be an efficient software development technique in industries due its capability to increase quality and productivity and decrease cost and time-tomarket through extensive reuse of software artifacts. To achieve these benefits, tool support is fundamental to guide industries during the SPL development life-cycle. However, many different SPL tools are available nowadays and the adoption of the appropriate tool is a big challenge in industries. In order to support engineers choosing a tool that best fits their needs, this paper presents the results of a controlled empirical study to assess two Eclipse-based tools, namely FeatureIDE and pure::variants. This empirical study involved 84 students who used and evaluated both tools. The main weakness we observe in both tools are the lack adequate mechanisms for managing the variability, such as for product configuration. As a strength, we observe the automated analysis and the feature model editor. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {The Product Line Architecture (PLA) is an important core asset of the Software Product Line (SPL) Engineering. The PLA design is a people-intensive task that requires architects to analyze PLA alternatives according to different architectural properties, such as cohesion and feature modularization. To reduce such efforts, PL As can be automatically obtained by using a search-based approach. But search-based PLA design (SBPD) is an incipient research topic with open research questions. One of them is the definition of a model to evaluate the PLA quality. In this sense, the present work introduces an enhanced evaluation model for SBPD that includes 17 objective functions involving 24 metrics (conventional and SPL metrics) to evaluate four important quality attributes of the PLA design: modularity, extensibility, understand- Ability and changeability. Obtained empirical results allow evidence that the evaluation model is useful for producing PLA designs whose quality correspond to the fitness values of the solutions obtained in the SBPD.},

  abstract  = {Feature modeling is the primary technology to capture and document the commonalities and variability among all of the members in a product line. Individual products are customized by selecting features according to the requirements. The work of feature selection is complex because of: 1) the complex dependencies and constraint relationship amongst features; 2) the multiple competing and conflicting non-functional requirements (NFRs); 3) the constraints to NFRs; 4) the explicit functional requirements. To select optimized feature set that conforms to the feature relations and satisfies both the functional and nonfunctional requirements and the related constraints, an evolutionary algorithm template which employs multi-objective optimization algorithms to optimally select features in SPLs, is proposed. In the experiments, two different algorithms are designed based on our template. Empirical results show the remarking performance of our algorithms on time especially when the feature models are large and complex.

  abstract  = {Feature Models (FMs) are a mechanism to model variability among a family of closely related software products, i.e. a software product line (SPL). Analysis of FMs using formal methods can reveal defects in the specification such as inconsistencies that cause the product line to have no valid products. A popular framework used in research for FM analysis is Alloy, a light-weight formal modeling notation equipped with an efficient model finder. Several works in the literature have proposed different strategies to encode and analyze FMs using Alloy. However, there is little discussion on the relative merits of each proposal, making it difficult to select the most suitable encoding for a specific analysis need. In this paper, we describe and compare those strategies according to various criteria such as the expressivity of the FM notation or the efficiency of the analysis. This survey is the first comparative study of research targeted towards using Alloy for FM analysis. This review aims to identify all the best practices on the use of Alloy, as a part of a framework for the automated extraction and analysis of rich FMs from natural language requirement specifications. {\textcopyright} 2016, Open Publishing Association.

One intention is to drive refactoring into software product lines and combine architecture recovery with run time binary analysis and existing clustering methods. Using our runtime binary analysis, we create graphs that capture the dependencies between different software parts. These are clustered into smaller component graphs, that group software parts with high interactions into larger entities. The component graphs serve as a basis for further software product line work. In this paper, we concentrate on the analysis part of the method and the graph clustering. We apply the graph clustering method to a real application in the context of automation / robot configuration software tools. {\textcopyright} Peake et al.},

With the evolution of our research and the addition of new features to the SPL, we identified limitations in the initial architectural design of PLeTs' components, which led us to redesign its Software Product Line Architecture (SPLA). In this paper, we discuss the main issues that led to changes in our SPLA, as well as present the design decisions that facilitate its evolution in the context of an industrial environment. We will also report our experiences on architecture modifications in the evolution of our SPL with the intention of allowing easier maintenance in a volatile development environment.

Domain requirements are core domain asset in software product line engineering, and requirement analysis for domain products or solutions based on domain requirements is a key step. Previous domain requirement models are suitable to model tens of variabilities in a domain which contains only a limited number of products. But in a solution domain such as SDP (service delivery platform) domain of telecom, there are thousands of variabilities among the solutions. In this paper, a new domain requirement model for solution domains is proposed. In this model, domain requirements are organized with three kinds of aggregation relationships and three kinds of generalization relationships. Based on these relationships, a configuration model is proposed to analyze the commonalities and variabilities among domain solutions. A solution requirement analysis method is also described based on the new domain requirement model. A case study is conducted on SDP domain which demonstrates how the proposed domain requirement model and solution requirement analysis method is used.},

  abstract  = {Software product line engineering is about producing a set of related products that share more commonalities than variabilities. Feature models are widely used for variability and commonality management in software product lines. Feature models are information models where a set of products are represented as a set of features in a single model. The automated analysis of feature models deals with the computer-aided extraction of information from feature models. The literature on this topic has contributed with a set of operations, techniques, tools and empirical results which have not been surveyed until now. The paper associated to this contribution provides a comprehensive literature review on the automated analysis of feature models 20 years after of their invention. It contributes by bringing together previously disparate streams of work to help shed light on this thriving area. We also present a conceptual framework to understand the different proposals as well as categorise future contributions. We finally discuss the different studies and propose some challenges to be faced in the future. Fifty three primary studies were analysed from where we report 30 operations of analysis and four different groups of proposals to automate those operations. The main target audience of this literature review are researchers in the field of automated analysis, tool developers or practitioners who are interested in analysis of feature models as well as researchers and professionals of information systems interested in software product lines, their models and analyses. 2011 {\textcopyright} Universidade da Coru{\~{n}}a.},

Feature models are commonly used for depicting the identified commonalities and variations. However, it requires significant time and effort to perform domain analysis and to create a feature model. We introduce a method and a tool for automatic extraction of a feature model based on a given set of android based portable devices. We use native applications that extract information regarding the available features, sensors and other peripherals. Hence, our approach does not require any manual effort, for instance, to create product specifications as input. We performed an industrial case study with a real product family of a consumer electronics company. We observed promising results in which a feature model is automatically constructed and the accuracy of the model is approved by product managers.},

Recent research work explores the integration between them to allow reuse and variability management in the context of complex systems. However, the automatic product derivation process is not addressed in the current literature. In this paper, we present our approach to deal with multi-agent systems product lines (MAS-PL) variability management and automatic product derivation. Our approach is implemented as an extension of the GenArch product derivation tool. A case study illustrates how the proposed approach can be used to derive products (instances) from a MAS-PL. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

In this paper, we analysis two popular optimization technique for finding qualified features for next release. In this case, the qualification of features is determined by the product value, product integrity, and AND dependencies between features. This study may help a software manager in feature selection. For this purpose, first, we encoded the feature model into a binary string. Then we able to find possible alternatives by using binary multi-objective genetic search algorithm NSGA-II and particle swarm optimization PSO. From these options, the product line manager can quickly select the best-fitted solutions according to the requirements. In this implementation, a feature model called ONLINE ELECTRONIC SHOPPING from Software Product Line Online Tool SPLOT is used where the total number of features is 290 assuming that 136 features are already implemented in the existing software. Finally, 30 out of 154 features are selected successfully in five product variants. The empirical result shows that GA performs better than PSO. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Theories about the product line paradigm already exist for multiple decades, but empirical research and reports of real life success stories are still scarce. Companies often still struggle to implement a software product line, because they don't possess the necessary knowledge and therefore do not sufficiently focus on the most basic aspect of a product line, namely the variability. Variability is the key to systematic and successful reuse, and should be considered as soon as possible in any software engineering project. The goal of the research is to develop a methodology for dealing explicitly with variability in software product lines during requirements engineering, because its impact will be maximal during this phase of software engineering. The methodology will be developed based on case-study research, in order to ensure practical relevance.},

This task is rendered challenging when a product's customer base is large and diverse. In this scenario, existing profiling approaches, such as operational profiling, are difficult to apply. In this work, we considerpublicly available video tutorials of a product to profile usage. Our goal is to construct an automatic approach to extract information about user actions from instructional videos. To achieve this goal, we use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to recognize user actions. Our pilot study shows that a DCNN trained to recognize user actions in video can classify five different actions in a collection of 236 publicly available Microsoft Word tutorial videos (published on YouTube). In our empirical evaluation we report a mean average precision of 94.42{\%} across all actions. This study demonstrates the efficacy of DCNN-based methods for extracting software usage information from videos. Moreover, this approach may aid in other software engineering activities that require information about customer usage of a product.},

  abstract  = {Software product lines (SPLs) and software ecosystems (SECOs) are approaches to capturing families of closely related software systems in terms of common and variable functionality. SPLs and especially SECOs are subject to evolution to adapt to new or changed requirements resulting in different versions of the software family and its variable assets. These versions may have to be maintained and used for products even after they were superseded by newer versions. Variability models describing valid combinations of variable assets, such as feature models, capture variability in space (configuration), but not variability in time (evolution) making it impossible to respect versions of variable assets in product definitions on a conceptual level. In this paper, we propose Hyper Feature Models (HFMs) explicitly providing feature versions as configurable units for product definition. Furthermore, we provide a version-aware constraint language to specify dependencies between features and ranges of feature versions as well as a procedure to automatically select valid combinations of versions for a pre-configuration of features. We demonstrate our approach in a case study. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

We can use aspect oriented software development to decompose software product lines based on features that can ease configuration management. In this paper, we present a military maintenance product line that employs such strategy. In particular, we employed a specific approach, feature based modeling (FBM), in the construction of the system.We will discuss the specific advantages of FBM when applied to product lines. Such advantages include the functional decomposition of the system along user requirements (features) as aspects. Moreover, those features exhibit unidirectional dependency (i.e. among any two features, at most one depend on another) that enables developers analyze the effect of any modification they may make on any feature. In addition, any variations can be captured as aspects which can also be incorporated easily into the core asset if such variation is deemed to be important enough to be included in the product line for further evolution.},

This mixed-discipline engineering group encompasses some 350 employees working on multiple projects simultaneously for multiple customers. The product line approach provides an agile systems target-context for the agile systems engineering process - re-using common product-line hardware, firmware, and software whenever possible, evolving the product line with both internally-funded development and opportunities presented by customer project work, and accommodating special customer needs that grow the knowledge and capability base for potential later use in product-line extension. This article focuses on the mixed-discipline agile systems engineering process reviewed in the September, 2015, INCOSE Agile Systems Engineering Life Cycle Model (ASELCM) discovery workshop, and doesn't address the proprietary strategy and detail of the product line architecture. Notable elements that will be discussed include a parallel evolving product line roadmap as the strategic driving function, a facilitating central relationship-management role for systems engineering, synchronization of mixed engineering disciplines, an enabling infrastructure for agile hardware development, strong opportunity management complimenting traditional risk management, and comparison to the ASELCM Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) pattern.},

Because the platform must be able to derive all the family products, products are not allowed to evolve independently from the plateform, thus the propagation of the products changes must be managed efficiently. Instead of focusing on the change impact analysis we propose an approach to compare the evolution histories of the products and the platform illustrated through evolutionary trees built using the biological technique cladistics. This comparison yields important results concerning the change propagation. In this paper, we introduce the use of cladistics for software product lines to build evolutionary trees for platform and products, then we elaborate a mathematical analysis to compare these trees, afterwards we validate this work through a case study (mobile media software product lines). We also provide the design of an automated tool.},

Here, we propose a behavioral equivalence for feature transition systems (FTS) generalizing branching bisimulation for labeled transition systems (LTS). We prove that branching feature bisimulation for an FTS of a family of products coincides with branching bisimulation for the LTS projection of each the individual products. For a restricted notion of coherent branching feature bisimulation we furthermore present a minimization algorithm and show its correctness. Although the minimization problem for coherent branching feature bisimulation is shown to be intractable, application of the algorithm in the setting of a small case study results in a significant speed-up of model checking of behavioral properties. {\textcopyright} T.

  abstract  = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) with the constraint solving has been successfully applied to address the configuration optimization problem in software product line (SPL), for example, the state-of-the-art SATIBEA algorithm. However, each different MOEA with special search operator demonstrates the different strength and weakness in terms of optimality and convergence speed. The SATIBEA just combines the SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) constraint solving with the Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) for evaluating the algorithm performance. In this paper, we propose six hybrid algorithms which combine the SAT solving with different MOEAs. Case study is based on five large-scale, rich-constrained and real-world SPLs. Empirical results demonstrate that SATMOCell algorithm obtains a competitive optimization performance to the state-of-the-art that outperforms the SATIBEA in terms of quality Hypervolume metric for 2 out of 5 SPLs within the same time budget. Moreover, the convergence speed of SATMOCell and SATssNSGA2 is comparable after 10min terminal times. Particularly, the Hypervolume value of SATssNSGA2 reports the average improvement of 1.33{\%} after 20min terminal times. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {In Search based Software Engineering, well-known evolutionary algorithms are utilized to find the optimal solutions and address the configuration optimization problem for software product lines and trade off multiple often competing objectives. Previous work by Henard et al. showed the weakness of the constraint expressiveness and the optimality and speed. In this work, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which significantly improves the expressiveness from Boolean constraints to quantifier-free first-order constraints, particularly without sacrificing much performance. Furthermore, we propose a parallel portfolio approach. Empirical results demonstrate that this approach presents the performance superiority compared with the state-off-the-art and improves optimality as far as possible within a limited time budget. Finally, we present an overview of challenges in future.},

In order to support the construction and maintenance of core assets, various modeling methods have been proposed. However, the assessment of these methods is still in an incubation stage. In fact, only several frameworks for comparing and evaluating these methods have been suggested. These mainly refer to lists of criteria whose examination is sometimes subjective and opinion-dependent. In this paper, we call for empirical evaluation of the comprehension and utilization of core assets and report the initial results of a series of studies we performed in this context.},

The resulting concept lattice provides a rich notion which allows remarkable insights into the modularity and interactions of requirements. We formulate a number of problems that aspect-oriented product line requirements engineering should address, and present our solutions according to the concept lattice. We describe a case study applying our approach to analyze a mobile game product line's requirements, and review lessons learned. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

  abstract  = {Web services run in complex environments where it is desirable to be able to count on mechanisms to adapt them according to contextual changes. Manual adaptations are unfeasible in intricate service compositions that are built with highly dynamic Web services. However, the principles of Autonomic Computing could support their self-adaptation. In this paper, we propose a method for designing and implementing context-aware autonomous Web services in system families. It is based on Software Product Line (SPL) engineering to support their systematic reuse in mass production environments. Autonomic behavior is achieved by our Model-based Reconfiguration Engine for Web services (MoRE-WS). MoRE-WS leverages variability models at runtime as easy-to-understand and semantically rich adaptation policies for decision-making while the architecture of a Dynamic SPL (DSPL) allows a flexible service recomposition. A case study illustrates the applicability of our method. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The Product Line Architecture (PLA) plays a central role at the products development from a Software Product Line (SPL). PLA design is a people-intensive and non-Trivial task. So, PLA design can be considered a hard problem which could be formulated as an optimization problem with many factors to be solved by search algorithms. In this sense, the approach named MOA4PLA (Multi-Objective Approach for Product-Line Architecture Design) was proposed to automatically identify the best alternatives for a PLA design. This approach originally included metrics to evaluate basic design principles, feature modularization, design elegance and SPL extensibility. However, there are other relevant properties for PLA design. For this reason, the evaluation model of MOA4PLA was extended with metrics to measure the level of similarity and adaptability of the PLA. The objective of this work is to investigate the possible correlation between the metrics related to similarity and variability in order to decrease the number of functions to be optimized. To do this, three experiments were carried out. Empirical results allow to learn some lessons regarding to these metrics in the referred context. {\textcopyright}2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

This study is made in an industrial company producing blood analysis automatons. It aims at finding the most suitable notation to model requirements variability for the product line developed by the company. The paper provides a comparative survey on feature-based notations for requirements variability modeling. It introduces an evaluation framework based on criteria that are derived by studying the main engineers' expectations for such a notation. The evaluation is fulfilled by making out notations' metamodels. The use of these languages is systematically illustrated with the same example, adapted from the company context, in order to refine the notation selection approach. Finally, recommendations are done, and issues on making the approach systematic are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) enable customization by reusing commonalities and variabilities within a family of similar software systems. Design patterns are best practices of established solutions in object-oriented source code for recurring design challenges. Although certain design patterns realize variability, they are only defined in the context of stand-alone systems and not for SPLs. Employing design patterns to realize variability allows using best practices in design for SPL development. However, the exact usage of design patterns within SPLs has not been explored, and a formal notation to capture their usage within different features does not exist. In this work, we provide a model-based analysis method to determine the variability-aware usage of design patterns in source code within the context of Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP). Moreover, we introduce Family Role Models (FRMs) as an extension to role modeling, which offer a language-independent, unified, formal notation for decomposed design patterns. We apply the analysis method in a case study on the variability-aware usage of design patterns in feature-oriented SPLs and derive FRMs from the results.

  abstract  = {The widespread use of mobile devices and the heterogeneity of the users involve changes for usability evaluating of mobile applications. It is important to have methodologies and tools to perform usability specific studies for this type of applications in which the context of use is constantly changing. It is necessary that the usability tests are transparent for the user, usability and context data are automatically collected, the test code are not intrusive in the tested application and the tests support the variability of the devices. To achieve the above features, this article presents a framework called FUsAM (Framework of Usability for Mobile Applications) which is extensible and can generate and integrate usability testing in mobile applications. The design and implementation approach is based on Software Product Line (SPL) combined with Features Oriented Programming (FOP) and Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). A case study is also presented to prove the functionality. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Several issues, such as inter-organisational development of platforms, platforms that employ dynamic reconfiguration, and platforms as a vehicle to achieve certain quality attributes, are identified and discussed. Issues are analysed, and it is demonstrated how these can be deduced as shortcomings in scoping and variability management for nonfunctional quality attributes and dynamic architectures. {\textcopyright} IEE, 2004.},

  abstract  = {This paper examines the adoption of software product line engineering to implement digital differentiation of physical products. The introduction of such software-based variety can typically be challenging for firms innovating within the realm of a manufacturing paradigm. In particular, the mutual dependency between the organization design and product design of new product developing firms may counteract attempts to induce change through software product line engineering. On the basis of innovation theory and the notion of isomorphism, the paper presents a case study of digital differentiation at one of the world's largest automakers, GlobalCarCorp. Relating to the literatures of software product lines and product families, the contribution of the paper is a lens through which to understand the role of isomorphism in implementing digital differentiation in new product development. In addition, practical implications are derived from this in-depth study.},

  abstract  = {Identifying design patterns within an existing software system can support understandability and reuse of the system's core functionality. In this context, incorporating behavioral features into the design pattern recovery would enhance the scalability of the process. The main advantage of the new approach in this paper over the existing approaches is incorporating dynamic analysis and feature localization in source code. This allows us to perform a goal-driven design pattern detection and focus ourselves on patterns that implement specific software functionality, as opposed to conducting a general pattern detection which is susceptible to high complexity problem. Using a new pattern description language and a matching process we identify the instances of these patterns within the obtained classes and interactions. We use a two-phase matching process: i) an approximate matching of class attributes generates a list of candidate patterns; and ii) a structural matching of classes identifies exact matched patterns. One target application domain can be software product line which emphasizes on reusing core software artifacts to construct a reference architecture for several similar products. Finally, we present the result of a case study.},

Experimental surveys (surveys with experimental design) are frequently used in social and medical sciences, but are not exploited adequately in software engineering. This paper does an attempt to use the experimental survey technique for the empirical evaluation of a new product line requirements engineering approach called issue-based variability modeling. The focus of this paper is mainly on survey and questionnaire design, and covers issues such as sampling and statistical analysis. In this survey, a population of 34 professionals was sampled into an experimental and a control group using stratified random sampling. A workshop was organized with the experimental group using issue-based variability modeling while the control group used an existing variability modeling approach. At the end of the workshop a self-administrated questionnaire was given to both the groups and the data was collected. The survey data analysis was done using basic statistics.},

Empirical research in software engineering collects and studies the quantitative/qualitative data in order to understand and improve the software product, software development process and software management. The empirical research methods are classified into controlled experiment, case study and survey, and the process of empirical study can be divided into experimental/case study setting, data collection, and data analysis. The protocol analysis, as one of the experimental methods, includes introspective, retrospective and think-aloud approaches. In this talk, I brief several empirical research methods in software engineering, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. A new approach: dialog-based protocol is then introduced. A case study is conducted for evaluation purpose. At the end, the threats and opportunities of empirical research in software engineering are discussed.},

  abstract  = {[Background] Bug-fixing could be complex in industrial practice since thousands of products share features in their configuration. Despite the importance and complexity of bug-fixing, there is still a lack of empirical data about the difficulties found in industrial Software Product Lines (SPLs). [Aims] This paper aims to evaluate engineers' performance fixing errors and propagating the fixes to other configured products in the context of an industrial SPL. [Method] We designed and conducted an empirical study to collect data with regard to bug-fixing tasks within the context of a Induction Hob SPL in the BSH group, the largest manufacturer of home appliances in Europe. [Results] We found that effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction got reached good values. Through interviews we also found difficulties related to unused features, cloning features unintentionally, detecting modified features, and propagating the fix when the source of the bug is the interaction between features. [Conclusions] The identified difficulties are relevant to know how to better apply SPLs in industry in the future. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

  abstract  = {Feature models are considered a reference in the majority of Software Product Line (SPL) methods. There are several different feature model notations to represent requirements of an SPL, at a higher or lower level of abstraction. Some notations present properties to distinguish functional, conceptual and non-functional features of an SPL. Non-functional requirements, especially those that involve the construction of user interfaces (UI), are usually not represented in the feature models, since the user interfaces are often created manually for each product. In this paper we present an experimental study performed in order to evaluate the effort required to, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of representing UI elements during the feature modeling of a Financial SPL. To this end, we applied the Odyssey-Fex and UI-Odyssey-Fex notations to design feature models from the perspective of Domain Engineers in the context of undergraduates, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students and software engineers with some expertise in SPL. Our results indicate that the effort to use the notations are similar, but the use of the UIOdyssey- Fex notation provides a better representativeness of UI elements.},

As a particularly novel approach, variability management at runtime demands proper guidance for software engineers. Although there is a number of variability modeling techniques, understand whether they fulfill important requirements to deal with the DSPL challenges is necessary. In this work, we analyzed two variability modeling techniques with regard to their effectiveness and efficiency based on a controlled experiment conducted with 10 students. Data from performed tasks and background and feedback questionnaires were gathered and analyzed. The results showed Context-aware Feature Model technique more effective than Tropos Goal Model with Context technique considering precision. Nevertheless, both techniques were effective considering recall.},

  abstract  = {Object Algebras are a design pattern that enables extensibility, modularity, and reuse in mainstream object-oriented languages such as Java. The theoretical foundations of Object Algebras are rooted on Church encodings of datatypes, which are in turn closely related to folds in functional programming. Unfortunately, it is well-known that certain programs are difficult to write and may incur performance penalties when using Church-encodings/folds. This paper presents EVF: An extensible and expressive Java Visitor framework. The visitors supported by EVF generalize Object Algebras and enable writing programs using a generally recursive style rather than folds. The use of such generally recursive style enables users to more naturally write programs, which would otherwise require contrived workarounds using a fold-like structure. EVF visitors retain the type-safe extensibility of Object Algebras. The key advance in EVF is a novel technique to support modular external visitors. Modular external visitors are able to control traversals with direct access to the data structure being traversed, allowing dependent operations to be defined modularly without the need of advanced type system features. To make EVF practical, the framework employs annotations to automatically generate large amounts of boilerplate code related to visitors and traversals. To illustrate the applicability of EVF we conduct a case study, which refactors a large number of non-modular interpreters from the "Types and Programming Languages" (TAPL) book. Using EVF we are able to create a modular software product line (SPL) of the TAPL interpreters, enabling sharing of large portions of code and features. The TAPL software product line contains several modular operations, which would be non-trivial to define with standard Object Algebras.},

  abstract  = {Variability modeling is an essential activity for the success of software product lines. Although existing literature presents several variability management approaches, there is no empirical evidence of their effectiveness for representing variability at component level. SMarty is an UML-based variability management approach that currently supports use case, class, activity, sequence and component models. SMarty 5.1 provides a fully compliant UML profile (SMartyProfile) with stereotypes and tagged-values and a process (SMartyProcess) with a set of guidelines on how to apply such stereotypes towards identifying and representing variabilities. At component level, SMarty 5.1 provides only one stereotype, â¤variableâ¥, which means that any classes of a given component have variability. Such a stereotype is clearly not enough to represent the extent of variability modeling in components, ports, interfaces and operations. Therefore, this paper presents how the improved version (5.2) of SMarty can identify and represent variability on such component-related elements, as well as an experimental study that provides evidence of the SMarty effectiveness.

  abstract  = {Software requirements analysis is crucial for any software project and it is the basis of requirements reuse within Software Product Line engineering. Software requirements specifications are usually expressed in natural language, which are informal, imprecise and ambiguous, thus analyzing them automatically is a challenging task. Although methods towards automatic analysis of software requirements have been studied before, many of them have limitations and effective researches in this area are still lacking. Therefore, in this paper a new approach was proposed to automatically extract structured information of functional requirements from Software Requirements Specifications in natural language. The methods of machine learning, natural language processing and semantic analysis were employed and combined in this approach. With a 10-fold cross validation setting, the method was evaluated on a manually annotated corpus. The experiments show that this approach achieves a good performance. Moreover, it was found that the model trained on the requirements dataset of the Ecommerce systems, can be used to extract semantic information from the requirements of auto-maker systems. The cross-domain extraction results show that the method of this paper is domain independent and robust to some extent. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Unsuitable architecture can precipitate disaster because the architecture determines the structure of the project. To prevent this, software architecture must be evaluated. The current evaluation methods, however, focus on single product architecture, and not product line architectures and they hardly consider the characteristics of the product lines, such as the variation points. This paper describes the extension of a scenario-based analysis technique for software product architecture-called EATAM, which not only analyzes the variation points of the quality attribute using feature modeling but also creates variability scenarios for the derivation of the variation points using the extended PLUC tag approach. This is a method that aims to consider the tradeoffs in the variability scenarios of the software product family architecture. The method has been validated through a case study involving microwave oven software product line in the appliance domain. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

It not only provides specification of local dependency such as decomposition and generalization, but also provides global dependency modeling such as configuration dependency, operational dependency and impact dependency. Finally a case study of feature dependency modeling in air-condition controlling software product line is presented to demonstrate our method. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {A widely used approach to develop a Service Provider (SP) in the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), called contract-first, consists of designing service contracts that will be used to generate the SP source code. The goal of a service contract is expressing the features (e.g., services and capabilities) of the required SP. The two most known traditional service contracts in the literature are: WSDL and WADL. We identify that these service contracts suffer from several problems, such as they only allow expressing a limited set of features. In order to overcome such problems, we propose a Feature Model (FM), named FMsp, that can be considered as a service contract for SP. The features of FMsp are designed to generate valid, customized and fully functional SPs. A key point in our FMsp is that it relies on SOA Design Patterns (DPs) to define its features. The constraints expressed between the DPs in our FMsp allow to easily developing valid compound DPs in the SP. Because DPs are proven solutions, then our FMsp will generate proven SPs as well. We evaluate our FMsp through a practical case study. The results show that the advantage of our FMsp compared with the traditional service contracts is, it permits to automatically generates valid, customized, fully functional and based-DP SPs in a short time. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Software product line plays a big role in minimizing cost, utilization of resource and maximizes chances to achieve the objective(s). Feature model is used to represent SPL. In our paper, the genetic algorithm is applied for feature optimization in software product line. We have designed and assessed our method by using it on an application with many different and complex dependencies among features. Further, we have also, optimized the feature model for those features that are highly used, are backbone functionality of software application and contribute to a larger extent in terms of customer attraction, satisfaction, iteration and retention. We have reported our experiment results against analysing 10 feature models with small set to large sets of features. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Test models are defined as hierarchical Markov chains for specifying possible usage of features for these systems. Variability among these features is documented with a feature model. Optional and alternative features in the feature model are mapped to a set of states in test models. Transition probabilities for these states are then modified according to the selected features so that the generated test cases focus only on these features. We conducted a controlled experiment in an industrial setting to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool. We observed that the tool reduces costs significantly and the cost of product line engineering adoption can be amortized for a small product family with 13 products.},

  abstract  = {Product line architecture (PLA)is one of the important assets in Software Product Line (SPL). In PLA there are numerous variation points and variants in which software engineers can decide and select as the best or suitable enough design decision for the PLA. Therefore it's crucial for SPL to have an explicit architecture design decision representation to enable the important knowledge to be reused in several similar applications in the product line.Though there are many proposals towards incorporating design decision in SPL, however it is still lacking in dealing with multiple criteria and fuzziness of the PLA design decision. In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by incorporating Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) in the design decision. Our approach considers the use of architecturally significant requirements, which is the quality attributes in the design decision. We demonstrate our approach using the case study of Autonomous Mobile Robot Product Line (AMRPL). The findingstend to show a potential use of FAHP in the design decision. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Requirements engineering is often, especially in the context of major open source software projects, performed with issue tracking systems such as Jira or Bugzilla. Issues include requirements expressed as bug reports, feature requests, etc. Such systems are at their best at managing individual requirements life-cycle. The management of dependencies between issues and holistic analysis of the whole product or a release plan is usually scantly supported. Feature modeling is an established way to represent dependencies between individual features, especially in the context of Software Product Lines-well-researched feature model analysis and configuration techniques exist. We developed a proof-of-concept dependency engine for holistically managing requirements. It is based on automatically mapping requirements and their dependencies into a variant of feature models, enabling utilization of existing research. The feature models are further mapped into a constraint satisfaction problem. The user can experiment with different configurations of requirements. The system maintains the consistency of dependencies and resource constraints. To evaluate the feasibility of the system, we measure the performance of the system both with some real and generated requirements. Despite some remaining performance issues, it seems that the approach can scale into managing the requirements of large software projects. {\textcopyright} 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {University employment and, specifically, employability has steadily gained relevance nowadays as the study of these fields can lead to improvement in the quality of life of individual citizens. However, the empirical research is still insufficient to make significant decisions within this domain. It is necessary to rely on powerful tools in order to reach insights about university employment and employability. Information dashboards have become a key software tool to reach insights and make informed decisions about a specific topic, domain or field of study. Nevertheless, dashboards' users can have several requirements that differ from each other (including displayed information itself, design features or even functionalities), and it is necessary to take into account all of these specifications, allowing users to exploit data with its own necessities and aiming to its own goals. Applying software product line paradigms, it is plausible to face different requirements regarding information dashboards' development in an efficient, scalable and maintainable way. To validate this approach, a case study is presented in the context of the Spanish Observatory of Employability and University Employment, an organization that aims to become an information reference for these fields.},

  abstract  = {Software testing process has a high cost when compared to the other stages of software development. Automation of software testing through reuse of software artifacts (e.g. models) is a good alternative for mitigating these costs and making the process much more efficient and efficacious. Model-Based Testing (MBT) is a technique to automatic generation of testing artifacts based on software models. For software development, the most spread modeling language in either the industrial or academic environments is UML. In such environments, it is desirable to reuse UML models also for MBT. avoiding re-building a different model exclusively for testing automation. These are the main reasons that make these semi-formal models an alternative to implementing MBT. Even though there are a lot of testing tools available commercially, to the best of our knowledge, none of them fully uses MBT. Therefore, this paper describes a case study showing how to implement the MBT process to automate test scripts generation and execution in a real-world, context. Furthermore, our solution is generated automatically by a Software Product Line (SPL).},

By exploring strategies for generic test cases, I hope to address problems of domain-level testing. Our work will investigate existing testing (SPLT) practices in variability management context by conducting empirical studies. We plan to synthesize principles for generic test case design, identify gaps between required and exiting techniques, and finally propose new approach for generic adaptive test case construction.},

While FOP targets at large-scale building blocks and compositional programming, generics provide fine-grained customization at type-level. We contribute an analysis that reveals the individual capabilities of both approaches with respect to program customization. Therefrom, we extract guidelines for programmers in what situations which approach suffices. Furthermore, we present a fully implemented language proposal that integrates FOP and generics in order to combine their strengths. Our approach facilitates two-staged program customization: (1) selecting sets of features; (2) parameterizing features subsequently. This allows a broader spectrum of code reuse to be covered - reflected by proper language level mechanisms. We underpin our proposal by means of a case study.},

The purpose of this chapter is to present a literature review relevant to a study of using agile methods to manage the development of Internet websites and their subsequent quality. This chapter places website quality within the context of the {\$}2.4 trillion U.S. electronic commerce industry. Thus, this chapter provides a history of electronic computers, electronic commerce, software methods, software quality metrics, agile methods and studies on agile methods. None of these histories are without controversy. For instance, some scholars begin the study of the electronic computer by mentioning the emergence of the Sumerian text, Hammurabi code or the abacus. We, however, will align our history with the emergence of the modern electronic computer at the beginning of World War II. The history of electronic commerce also has poorly defined beginnings. Some studies of electronic commerce begin with the widespread use of the Internet in the early 1990s. However, electronic commerce cannot be appreciated without establishing a deeper context. Few scholarly studies, if any, have been performed on agile methods, which is the basic purpose of this literature review. That is, to establish the context to conduct scholarly research within the fields of agile methods and electronic commerce.},

  abstract  = {Since software product lines (SPLs) increasingly have to satisfy additional requirements, their designs might degenerate over time. The degeneration is caused by various reasons. For instance, the features suddenly start to be realized and they evolved in inconsistent ways across multiple products. In an extreme case, the SPL code is fully or partially replicated and individually changed across several evolving products. In order to regain control of the SPL assets, a key activity is the design recovery of features from existing applications. However, existing techniques for feature analysis are not effective as they tend to explicitly rely on a single project history. They do not take into consideration change histories of features across multiple evolving products of a SPL. This research proposes a novel technique for history-sensitive feature recovery while repairing degenerated SPL designs. Our technique is ought to encompass a set of heuristics for facilitating SPL design recovery. We aim at investigating to what extent exploiting multi-product change histories allow accurate identification of: (i) code elements that contribute to each feature realization; and (ii) variability properties of the feature code. The empirical evaluation of our technique will be based on two industry case studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) enable software reuse by systematically managing commonalities and variability. Usually, commonalities and variability are expressed by features. Functional requirements of a software product are met by selecting appropriate features. However, selecting features also influences non-functional properties. To satisfy non-functional requirements of a software product, as well, the effect of a feature selection on non-functional properties has to be known. Often an SPL allows a vast number of valid products, which renders a test of non-functional properties on the basis of all valid products impractical. Recent research offers a solution to this problem: the effect of features on non-functional properties of software products is predicted by measuring in advance. A sample of feature configurations is generated, executed with a predefined benchmark, and then non-functional properties are measured. Based on these data a model is created that allows to predict non-functional properties of a software product before actually building it. However, in some domains contextual influences, such as input data, can heavily affect nonfunctional properties. We argue that the measurement of the effect of features on non-functional properties can be drastically improved by considering contextual influences of a domain. We study this assumption on input data as an example for a contextual influence and using an artificial but intuitive case study from the domain of compression algorithms. Our study shows that prediction accuracy of non-functional properties can be significantly improved.},

  abstract  = {Producing software variations from the same software product line requires developers to adopt developing tools that support variability. The Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) is a modeling language that facilitates the generation of various software products from a single code base. One part of ABS is the Product Selection Language (PSL), which is used to specify software products as sets of features. Even though some products might share some features, using PSL, all features in a product need to be stated one by one. If the product is obtained from tens to hundreds of features, defining the product will be difficult and inefficient To remedy this situation, we extend the PSL such that products can be declared incrementally, by referring to other products. Such declarations contain product expressions that use set-theoretic operations (i.e., union, intersection, complement) over products and sets of features. We evaluate our extended PSL with a case study of a Charity Organization System developed at the RSE Research Lab in the Faculty of Computer Science at Universitas Indonesia. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Software Product Line Engineering is an approach to management of diversity in software families. Although several SPLE approaches exist in the domains of industrial software applications, product lines of data-intensive software systems have gained less attention. We use an incremental, delta-oriented technique to handle variability by specifying changes to be made to a core data model to define the data schemas of the products. We present a new merge-prune operator based on the superimposition of models as well as the structural well-formedness rules specified formally in Alloy. Our method provides a modular way to handle variability in data intensive systems. It is scalable with respect to the number of variation points in the system in contrast to the traditional annotative approaches for variability modeling. We have investigated the applicability of our approach by using it in a real-world case study. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Here, some questions referring to the technological challenges of building product lines is addressed.

Lean Startup is a method for startup management that focuses on quick iteration and on fast learning to find an iterable business model. As a method, Lean Startup is still quite novel. It does not have much scientific literature written about it, but it is used by startups. The two case study companies were both positive about Lean Startup and felt that the method had given them a helpful approach.},

  abstract  = {In Software Architecture, several approaches focus first on selecting architectural tactics to address quality attributes and later use the corresponding design alternatives to create application architectures. Regrettably, sometimes the alternatives used to improve some quality attributes inhibit or reduce the achievement of others. These conflicts, known as trade-off points, lead to trade-off decisions to solve them. Usually, detection of trade-off points and guidance for trade-off decisions rely on the expertise of software architects. The architect has to (1) identify and analyze the conflict on design alternatives, (2) determine which quality attributes and tactics motivated the selection of conflicting alternatives, and (3) decide about which set of non-conflicting tactics to use. This paper presents an approach based on feature models to help manage trade-offs. It is based on the specification of relationships between architectural tactics and design alternatives that describe, for each tactic, which combination of designs can be used or must not be used. When a set of tactics are selected to implement an architecture, these relationships serve to determine the set of alternatives to use. In addition, they aid to detect trade-off points and determine the tactics to consider in a trade-off decision. We present a formalization of our approach and illustrate it using a case study on tactics and patterns for database-based web applications. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Software development based on the software product-line can develop software products more easily and fast by reusing the developed core assets. One of key issues of software product-line is to handle variability between product families. That is, the variation management for software product-line decides the success of software development. There are considerable researches relating to model the variability in software product-line. However, the existing researches do not explicitly define artifacts and any relevant relationships between them used in each process. Therefore, in this paper, processes and artifacts of each process to manage uniformly variability over the life cycle of software product-line are proposed. Furthermore, in order to show how to apply those into a specific domain, especially electronic medical record (EMR) system, case study is presented},

This paper introduces MatrixMiner: A tool for automatically synthesizing product comparison matrices (PCMs) from a set of product descriptions written in natural language. MatrixMiner is capable of identifying and organizing features and values in a PCM - despite the informality and absence of structure in the textual descriptions of products. Our empirical results of products mined from BestBuy show that the synthesized PCMs exhibit numerous quantitative, comparable information. Users can exploit MatrixMiner to visualize the matrix through a Web editor and review, refine, or complement the cell values thanks to the traceability with the original product descriptions and technical specifications. {\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.},

  abstract  = {Software implementation is one of the important steps in a software engineering process. It consists of integrating software based services or components in business alignment with the organizational view and acceptance from the users' perspectives. However, this step is complex and not supported in detail by the existing design and implementation methods. When implementing a software product in a customer organization with a specific context, the problem of the choice of the method or its adaptation is crucial to ensure the implementation success. Software producing organizations have difficulty with the creation of the most suitable implementation method for their software products. Situational Method Engineering (SME) proposes solutions to create methods adapted to the project at hand. We propose an approach to build an implementation method based on the association of method fragments, offering two advantages: it facilitates (a) the modeling of fragments by using the Process Deliverable Diagram formalism (PDD) that has proved its efficacy and simplicity, and (b) the selection of fragments by using metrics to analyze them. We illustrate our proposal with a case study to create an implementation method for a personal health management software product.},

  abstract  = {Highly-configurable systems allow users to tailor the software to their specific needs. Not all combinations of configuration options are valid though, and constraints arise for technical or non-technical reasons. Explicitly describing these constraints in a variability model allows reasoning about the supported configurations. To automate creating variability models, we need to identify the origin of such configuration constraints. We propose an approach which uses build-time errors and a novel feature-effect heuristic to automatically extract configuration constraints from C code. We conduct an empirical study on four highly-configurable open-source systems with existing variability models having three objectives in mind: evaluate the accuracy of our approach, determine the recoverability of existing variability-model constraints using our analysis, and classify the sources of variability-model constraints. We find that both our extraction heuristics are highly accurate (93{\%} and 77{\%} respectively), and that we can recover 19{\%} of the existing variability-models using our approach. However, we find that many of the remaining constraints require expert knowledge or more expensive analyses. We argue that our approach, tooling, and experimental results support researchers and practitioners working on variability model re-engineering, evolution, and consistency-checking techniques. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

  abstract  = {Feature-oriented programming (FOP) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP) focus on to modularize incremental classes behavior and crosscutting concerns, respectively, for software evolution. So, these software development approaches represent advanced paradigms for a modular software product lines production. Thereby, a FOP and AOP symbiosis would permit reaching pros and cons of both approaches. FOP permits a modular refinement of classes collaboration for software product lines (SPL), an adequate approach to represent named heterogeneous crosscutting concerns. FOP works on changes of different functionality pieces for which to define join points is not a simple task. Similarly, AOP structurally modularizes in a refined manner homogeneous crosscutting concerns. Since traditional AOP like Aspect J presents implicit dependencies and strong coupling between classes and aspects, and the Join Point Interface JPI approach solves these classic AOP issues, this article presents JPI Feature Modules for the FOP + JPI SPL components modularization, i.e., collaboration of classes, aspects, and join point interfaces along with their evolution, for a SPL transparent implementation in a FOP + JPI context. In addition, this article shows JPI Feature Modules of a case study to highlight mutual benefits of FOP and JPI approaches for a modular SPL software conception.

  abstract  = {Software product lines are a proven development paradigm in industrial environments. However, its application in small organizations is not easy. Our approach uses the package merge mechanism of the UML 2 meta-model as representation of the variability in the product line. The structure of the variability models is directly reflected in the relationships between packages in the architectural models, so that the traceability of configuration decisions is straightforward. A similar strategy is applied at the implementation level, using packages of partial classes. The combination of these techniques and the conventional IDE tools make the developments of product lines in small organizations easier as it removes the need for specialized tools and personnel. This article reports a successful experience with a communicator product line case study, representative of the mobile systems domain. People with certain communication problems can use these systems as a low-cost help in their everyday life. As problems vary from a person to another, a communicator product line is the indicated solution, allowing the adequate personalization of the final application to the disability of each concrete person.},

  abstract  = {In software product family engineering reusable artifacts are produced during domain engineering and applications are built from these artifacts during application engineering. Modeling variability of current and future applications is the key for enabling reuse. The proactive reuse leads to a reduction in development costs and a shorter time to market. Up to now, these benefits have been realized for the constructive development phases, but not for testing. This paper presents the ScenTED technique (Scenario based TEst case Derivation), which aims at reducing effort in product family testing. ScenTED is a model-based, reuse-oriented technique for test case derivation in the system test of software product families. Reuse of test cases is ensured by preserving variability during test case derivation. Thus, concepts known from model-based testing in single system engineering, e.g., coverage metrics, must be adapted. Experiences with our technique gained from an industrial case study are discussed and prototypical tool support is illustrated. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

In addition to improving SCM support, our intent is to use our system as a large case study for evaluating languages and tools for model-driven development.},

  abstract  = {Software Product Lines (SPL) aim at deriving software architectures or systems from a software artifact base. Configuring the SPL to derive a new product is now usually done by selecting appropriate software features in a kind of models, called feature models. In some situations, a feature represents a software artifact associated to an element e of a context the software product will manage. Such a feature and its associated software artifact may be cloned according to the number of occurrences of e in the context and constraints have to be respected. Hence, the feature model proposed to users for configuration has to be adapted in a new dedicated phase according to the context elements. We propose a model-driven engineering approach for transforming a generic feature model according to a context model that a derived software product will manage. More precisely this paper describes an original model transformation able to generate context specific feature models including duplicated features, and removing inappropriate features. Our transformation is validated on a smart building optimization software case study. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.},

  abstract  = {We propose a model for feature-aware discrete-time Markov chains, called FDTMC, as a basis for verifying probabilistic properties, e.g., Reliability and availability, of product lines. To verify such properties on FDTMC, we compare three techniques. First, we experiment with two different parametric techniques to obtain this formula: the classical one builds it from the model as whole, and a new one that builds it compositionally from a sequence of modules. Finally, we propose a new technique that performs a bounded verification for the whole product line, and thus takes advantage of the high probability of common behaviors of the product line. It computes an approximate formula, represented as an arithmetic decision diagram. Experimental results on a vital signal monitoring system prototype are provided and compared for these techniques aiming at analysing them for scalability issues of size and computational time. They show complementary advantages, and we provide criteria to choose a technique depending on the characteristics of the model. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Model Transformations are a key element of Model-Driven Software Engineering. As soon as variability is involved, transformations become increasingly complicated. The lack of support for variability in model transformations impairs the acceptance of approaches to organized reuse such as software product lines. In this position paper, the general problem of multi-variant model transformations is formulated for MOF-based, XMI-serialized models. A simplistic case study is presented to specify the input and the expected output of such a transformation. Furthermore, requirements for tool support are defined, including a standardized representation of both multi-variant model instances and variability information, as well as an execution specification for multi-variant transformations. A literature review reveals that the problem is weakly identified and often solved using ad-hoc solutions; there exists no tool providing a general solution to the proposed problem statement. The observations presented here may serve for the future development of standards and tools. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

  abstract  = {In most IT projects, software developers usually pay attention to functional requirements that satisfy business needs of the system. Non-functional requirements (NFR) such as performance, usability, security, etc. are usually handled ad-hoc during the system testing phase, when it is late and costly to fix problems. Due to the importance and criticality of NFR, I study the problem of modeling NFR for Software Product Lines (SPL), which adds yet an additional dimension of complexity. This paper will survey the software engineering literature, in search of a systematic way to analyze and design NFR, from the perspectives of the concept of commonality and variability of SPL and the characteristics of NFR. Finally, I will propose a methodology based on the extension of Product Line UML-Based Software Engineering (PLUS) techniques, for a unified and automated method to model NFR throughout all phases of SPL engineering.},

The central purpose of DSPL is to handleadaptability at runtime through variability management, as wellas to maximize the reuse of components. Emerging domainssuch as the mobile applications and software-intensive embeddedsystems require changes and extensions to the design in terms ofboth functionality and adaptation capabilities. DSPL should alsodeal with the unavoidable changes, which reflect both user needsand execution environments. However, the evolution capability inDSPL so far has not been investigated in depth. In this paper, wereport on an exploratory study aimed at evaluating the objectorientedand aspect-oriented solutions on DSPL evolutionaryscenarios. In this empirical evaluation, the aspect-oriented solutionyielded better results in terms of measurements such asWeighted Operations per Component (WOC), Lines Of Code(LOC), Lack of Cohesion Over Operations (LCOO), Couplingbetween components (CBC), and Response For a Class (RFC). The use of aspects indicates that it provides assets with lowercomplexity, lower coupling, and higher cohesion. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Manage the evolution in Software Product Lines (SPL) can bring some benefits such as keep the traceability between assets in core assets and products, avoid some irregular growth or decrease before it becomes a threat to the system, and also use the products feedback to improve the core asset quality. In order to understand the evolution in SPL, this paper presents an empirical study to investigate evidence between information from features non-conformities and data from corrective maintenance, based on an SPL industrial project in the medical domain. The investigation aims at tracking the features non-conformities and their likely root causes using results from two preliminary studies. The first one captured and classified the features non-conformities from features specification of nine sub-domains and the second one investigated the evolution of SPL assets along the sub-domains development. The study sample was analyzed using statistical techniques, such as Spearman correlation rank and Poisson regression models. The findings indicated that there is significant positive correlation between feature non-conformities and corrective maintenance. Sub-domains with a high number of feature non-conformities had a higher number of corrective maintenance. Moreover, sub-domains qualified as high risk have also positive correlation with corrective maintenance. This correlation allows the building of predictive models to estimate corrective maintenance based on the risk sub-domain attribute values. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Test cases are derived by modeling the system under test, and have been widely applied in practice, such as for software product line testing, and combinatorial testing. Abstract test case prioritization (ATCP) is used to prioritize abstract test cases, and aims at achieving higher rates of fault detection. Many ATCP algorithms have been proposed, using different prioritization criteria and information. One ATCP approach makes use of fixed-strength level-combinations information covered by abstract test cases, and is called fixed-strength interaction coverage based prioritization (FICBP). Before using FICBP, the prioritization strength $\lambda$ needs to be decided. Previous studies have generally focused on $\lambda$ values ranging between 1 and 6. However, no study has investigated the appropriateness of such a range, nor how to assign the prioritization strength for FICBP. To answer these questions, this paper reports on an empirical study involving four real-life programs (each of which with six versions). The experimental results indicate that $\lambda$ should be set approximately equal to a value corresponding to half of the number of parameters, when testing resources are sufficient. Our results also show that when testing resources are limited or insufficient, either small or large $\lambda$ values are suggested for FICBP. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The widespread use of the product line approach allows companies to realize significant improvements in time-tomarket, cost, productivity, and quality. However, a fundamental problem in software product line engineering is that a product line of industrial size can easily incorporate several thousand variable features. The complexity caused by this amount of variability makes variability management and product derivation tasks extremely difficult. To address this problem, we present a new method to optimize the variability provided in a software product line. Our method constructs a visualization that provides a classification of the usage of variable features in real products derived from the product line. We show how this classification can be used to derive restructuring strategies for simplifying the variability. The effectiveness of our work is demonstrated by presenting a case study of optimizing the variability in a large industrial software product line. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

Feature-oriented verification must be able to analyze individual features and to compose the results into results on products. Since features interact through shared data, verifying individual features entails open system verification concerns. To verify temporal properties, features must be open to both propositional and temporal information from the remainder of the composed product. This paper addresses both forms of openness through a two-phase technique. The first phase analyzes individual features and generates sufficient constraints for property preservation. The second phase discharges the constraints upon composition of features into a product. We present the technique as well as the results of a case study on an email protocol suite.},

  abstract  = {Systematic reuse of software artifacts can be achieved with software product lines, which represent a family of similar software systems. A variability model, e.g., feature model, describes their commonalities and variabilities and serves as a basis for a product configuration, i.e., the selection of features according to constraints defined in the model. These variability models can contain additional information, such as attributes, which enrich features with typed values for various purposes (e.g., optimization, simplified readability). Typically, these attributes are not directly reusable in code artifacts as the variability model is only used to assemble or change code artifacts according to a product configuration. Furthermore, there are many languages for implementing software product lines such as DeltaJ which do not support the direct propagation of feature attributes to the associated code artifacts. In this paper, we present parametric DeltaJ, an adaptation of the programming language DeltaJ for delta-oriented software product lines in Java. parametric DeltaJ allows the propagation of typed attributes from an attributed feature model to Java code artifacts. We perform a case study to show that introducing parameters reduces the number of variables, delta modules and lines of code for delta-oriented software product lines. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2016 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.},

This is commonly done with feature diagrams - graph structures specifying the user visible characteristics of SPL's members and the dependencies among them. Despite the attention that feature diagrams attract, the identification of features and structuring them into feature diagrams remain challenging. In this study, we utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in order to explore dif-ferent patterns for identifying and structuring features from textual descriptions. Such a catalog of patterns is important for both manually-created and automati-cally-generated feature diagrams.},

Software families, also named SPLs, are a set of software intensive systems sharing a common set of features which are managed to satisfy specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way. This paper presents the PL-Science approach that considers the context of SPL and aims to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, specifying a workflow that encompasses scientific applications of a given experiment. Using SPL concepts, scientists can reuse models that specify the scientific product line, and carefully can make decisions according to their needs. In the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Lines (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Lines (SPL) due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and, using this abstract workflow model, the products (scientific applications/algorithms) will be instantiated. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to facilitate the process of applying Software Product Line (SPL) to scientific domains. Through the use of ontology as a domain model, we can provide additional information as well as add more semantics in the context of Scientific Software Product Lines (SSPL). {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

  abstract  = {This case study is about Pocket Code's build variants. Pocket Code is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for the brick based visual programming language Catrobat. It is released in various flavors for different partners and projects (e.g., Create@School, Phiro and Standalone). All flavors use the same code base but slightly differ in design and functionality. If different flavors are maintained as separate projects, all projects require proper maintenance. Any feature introduced or updated in one project must be ported to all others, for that they dont diverge. With an increase in the number of flavors, efforts to maintain will also increase which renders the project unmaintainable. If all flavors are maintained in one project, it is challenging to release more than one version of an application with a different set of functionalities and different user interface (UI) enhancements. In this paper, Pocket Code's different build variants are discussed particularly the standalone build variant. To build a standalone version of any app hosted on the Pocket Code sharing platform, the user has to trigger the build via the web interface on the remote Pocket Code server. Resource files and app configuration are generated based on user input. This paper can be of interest to organizations dealing with dynamic build variants triggered by external actors. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

Assuming dependencies between SPL application components and reference architecture implementation (a platform), this paper empirically investigates the relationship between 7 design metrics and changeability of 46 server components of a product line for business applications. In addition, we investigated the usefulness of Platform Responsibility (PR) metric as an indicator of product line component changeability. The results show that most of the design metrics are strongly related to the changeability of server component and also indicate statistically significant correlation between Maintainability Index (MI) and PR metric. The assessment is based on a case study of the implementation of the product line for business applications in a financial institution. The results show that PR metric can be used as good predictor of changeability in the software product line environment.},

  abstract  = {Hardware and software can be co-designed as a single system to obtain high-performance computing solutions that use a minimum of resources such as CPU cycles and memory. Hardware/software co-design is often a complex and time consuming process. Software functionality is typically developed independently from hardware functionality and functional elements are not reused across similar products. Co-design is particularly important in System on-Chip (SoC) development where an entire system consisting of both software and hardware is integrated on a single chip. Developing high-performance computing solutions in the form of SoCs in a repeatable manner is technically possible, but knowing how to apply software concepts in a hardware context and vice versa is still demanding at best. This paper summarizes the concepts and considerations that outline a case study that aims at combining the software product family paradigm with run-time reprogrammable hardware technology. The goal of the study is to define a formal framework for developing product families on-chip in a repeatable manner. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The Product Line Architecture (PLA) is an important asset for the success of Software Product Line (SPL) projects. Due to the complexity of managing the architectural variability, maintain the PLA up-to-date and synchronized with the project source code is a hard problem. The systematic use of Software Architecture Recovery (SAR) techniques enables the PLA recovery and keeps the PLA aligned with the development. In this context, we present our initial proposal that consists of an approach to recover PLAs based on the use of (bottom-up) SAR techniques. We performed some studies (such as surveys, literature reviews, and exploratory studies) to investigate the relationship between SAR and PLA to identify gaps and define the research area state-of-the-art. The combination of SAR and PLA is an important strategy to address some issues of PLA design. We identified that few studies address architectural variability, PLA variability traceability, and empirical evaluation such as experiments, surveys, mixed-methods, and so on.},

The "one document for n users" paradigm is being replaced by the "one user, one document" model, where the content to be delivered to a particular user is generated by some means. This is a very promising approach for e-Government, where personalized government services, including document generation, are more and more required by users. In this paper, we introduce a method to the generation of personalized documents called Document Product Lines (DPL). DPL allows generating content in domains with high variability and with high levels of reuse. We describe the basic principles underlying DPL and show its application to the e-Government field using the personalized tax statement as case study.},

For this purpose, we enrich the feature-oriented language FLAN with action rates, which specify the likelihood of exhibiting particular behaviour or of installing features at a specific moment or in a specific order. The enriched language (called PFLAN) allows us to specify models of software product lines with probabilistic configurations and behaviour, e.g. by considering a PFLAN semantics based on discrete-time Markov chains. The Maude implementation of PFLAN is combined with the distributed statistical model checker MultiVeStA to perform quantitative analyses of a simple product line case study. The presented analyses include the likelihood of certain behaviour of interest (e.g. product malfunctioning) and the expected average cost of products. {\textcopyright} M.H. ter Beek, A. Legay, A.

The rhetorical Questions, Options and Criteria (QOC) model can manage variability with justification. Thus, using QOC in the conventional variability management techniques of product line requirements engineering enhances the current state of variability management with reasoning and justification, which paves the way for a new concept called Rationalebased Variability Management in Requirements Engineering (RVMRE). In RVMRE, QOC is used in association with an existing variability representation techniques to address variability constraints and product instantiation in product line requirements engineering. Examples from a microwave oven product line are used for the case study and evaluation of the concepts are discussed in this paper.},

  abstract  = {In software product lines, multiple products of a software product family, share source code of common components. New features added to the common components of a software product family, are integrated into products following a selective code integration process. Selective code integration is a process in which developers pick the commits (i.e., code changes) related to a feature from one code branch and integrate them into another code branch. Developers often manually link the commits to the features to enable the selective integration of features. In current practice, not all dependent commits are always linked to features and developers might miss the unlinked commits during selective code integration. In this paper, we propose two grouping approaches that identify dependencies among commits and create groups of dependent commits that need to be integrated as a whole into a code branch. Our first approach is automatic and the other is developer-guided. Through a case study on data derived from a product line of mobile software applications, we show that our approaches can help to reduce by up to 94{\%} integration failures caused by missing commit dependencies. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The evolution of the requirements specification is a key activity for maintaining the goals of any software project and it has long been established and recognized by researchers and practitioners. Within Software Product Lines (SPL), this evolution is even more critical due to the necessity of dealing with common, variable, and product-specific requirements, not only for a single product but for the whole set of products. In this paper, we present the Feature-Driven Requirements Engineering Evolution (FeDRE2) approach, which provides support to evolve the requirements specification of SPL. The approach evolves the feature model and the use case specification from an SPL according to the user's needs. It also provides detailed guidelines on how to evolve chunks of features from a feature model and their related use case specifications. The evaluation of the approach is illustrated in an empirical study for evolving an SPL of mobile applications for emergency notifications. This empirical study was applied within 16 participants, 9 participants from Federal University of Bahia (Brazil) and 7 participants from Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain). Evaluations concerning the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, effectiveness, and efficiency as regards requirements analysts using the approach are also presented. The results have shown that FeDRE2 was perceived as easy to learn and useful by the participants.},

From organizational issues to purely technical challenges, there is a wide range of barriers that complicates SPL adoption. The workshop Reverse Variability Engineering (REVE) aims to foster research about making the most of the two main inputs for SPL migration: 1) domain knowledge and 2) legacy assets. Domain knowledge, usually implicit and spread across an organization, is key to define the SPL scope and to validate the variability model and its semantics. At the technical level, domain expertise is also needed to create or extract the reusable software components. Legacy assets can be, for instance, similar product variants (e.g., requirements, models, source code) that were implemented using ad-hoc reuse techniques such as clone-and-own. More generally, the workshop attracts researchers and practitioners contributing to processes, techniques, tools, or empirical studies related to the automatic, semi-automatic or manual extraction or refinement of SPL assets. {\textcopyright} 2017 ACM.},

  abstract  = {The Consumer Electronics Working Group (CEWG) in the Linux Foundation has identified several problems in the re-use process of embedded Linux software for consumer electronic devices. Among these is the increasing fragmentation of Linux derivatives. Vendors of electronic devices copy the Linux sources and make their modifications to adapt it to their own devices, but fail to back port their modifications to the mainstream Linux sources. Likewise, later improvements of the Linux sources are not integrated into the vendors' variants. CEWG launched the Long Term Support Initiative (LTSI) for an industry-managed tree of the Linux sources, maintained by CEWG, that is based on the long-term stable kernel tree annually updated with the latest mainstream kernel version to address their needs. In order to justify this initiative, CEWG asked us to investigate whether and if so how much non-upstream code can be found in industry products and to which extent to and for what part of the kernel. We used large-scale clone detection techniques to compare various Linux versions to their vendor-specific variants. We found many changes that were not back ported. Some of these changes were even found in Linux subsystems where neither we nor people from the Linux Foundation would expect them. We also found instances of defects fixed in the mainstream kernel that were not integrated into the vendors' code. Overall, our investigation provides enough evidence to support the need for an LTSI and better collaboration among Linux developers both of the mainstream and the vendor variants. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Model-based development has become a widely-used approach to implement software, e.g. for embedded systems. Models replace source code as primary executable artifacts in these cases. Software product line technologies for these domains must be able to generate models as instances of an SPL. This need is addressed among others by an implementation technology for SPLs known as delta modeling. Current approaches to delta modeling require deltas to be written manually using delta languages, and they offer only very limited support for creating and testing a network of deltas. This paper presents a new approach to delta modeling and a supporting tool suite: the abstract notion of a delta is refined to be a consistency-preserving edit script which is generated by comparing two models. The rich structure of edit scripts allows us to detect conflicts and further relations between deltas statically and to implement restructurings in delta sets such as the merging of two deltas. We illustrate the tooling using a case study. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {In the quest for energy efficiency of Information and Communication Technology, so far research has mostly focused on the role of hardware. However, as hardware technology becomes more sophisticated, the role of software becomes crucial. Recently, the impact of software on energy consumption has been acknowledged as significant by researchers in software engineering. In spite of that, measuring the energy consumption of software has proven to be a challenge, due to the large number of variables that need to be controlled to obtain reliable measurements. Due to cost and time constraints, many software product organizations are unable to effectively measure the energy consumption of software. This prevents them to be in control over the energy efficiency of their products. In this paper, we propose a software energy profiling method to reliably compare the energy consumed by a software product across different releases, from the perspective of a software organization. Our method allows to attribute differences in energy consumption to changes in the software. We validate our profiling method through an empirical experiment on two consecutive releases of a commercial software product. We demonstrate how the method can be applied by organizations and provide an analysis of the software related changes in energy consumption. Our results show that, despite a lack of precise measurements, energy consumption differences between releases of a software product can be quantified down to the level of individual processes. Additionally, the results provide insights on how specific software changes might affect energy consumption.},

The main thrust of this paper is to discuss software engineering aids to address this concern. Firstly, we brief the adult literacy case study and GAMBLE framework that form the basis for discussion in this paper. Then we present two major software engineering aids that we have devised during our experience (i) GAMBLE Platform that integrates multiple reasoning technologies to support modeling instructional material in the form of data (facts, cases, rules, models - fcrm) and an interactive environment GURU for both teachers and learners alike to enrich their teaching/learning experience (ii) Applying software product lines to address scale and variety challenges of educational technologies. Finally, we succinctly present Lean Software Product Lines as a potential future direction. The discussion in this paper is based on analyzing and improving a decade-long technology for adult literacy for over four and half years. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

However, a development process covering the whole SPLE lifecycle and using agile practices in small and medium size development projects has not been established yet. There is a need to disseminate such combination through well-defined roles, activities, tasks and artifacts. This paper presents SPLICE, a lightweight development process combining SPLE and agile practices, following reactive and extractive approaches to build similar systems. SPLICE addresses the needs of small development teams aiming to adopt SPL practices with low upfront costs and fast return on investment. In order to evaluate our proposal, we report our experience in a case study by developing Rescue MeSPL, a product line for mobile applications that assists users in emergency situations. The case study results point SPLICE achieves the three evaluated aspects by providing short and proper iterations, possibilities for activities adaptations and continuous feedback. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic software product lines (DSPL) constitute a promising approach for developing highly-configurable, runtime-adaptive systems in a feature-oriented way. A DSPL integrates both variability in time and space in a unified conceptual framework. For this, domain features are equipped with additional binding time information to distinguish between static configuration parameters and dynamically (re-) configurable features. Until now, little support exists to specify and validate staged (re-)configuration semantics for DSPLs in a concise way. In this paper, we propose conservative extensions to domain feature models comprising variable feature binding times together with different kinds of binding time constraints. Those extensions are motivated by a real-world industrial case study from the automation engineering domain. Our implementation performs a model transformation into plain feature models treatable by corresponding state-of-the-art analysis tools. We conducted an evaluation of our approach concerning the case study. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

  abstract  = {Software Product Line Engineering is a key approach to construct applications with systematical reuse of architecture, documents and other relevant components. To migrate legacy software into a product line system, it is essential to identify the code segments that should be constructed as features from the source base. However, this could be an error-prone and complicated task, as it involves exploring a complex structure and extracting the relations between different components within a system. And normally, representing structural information of a program in a mathematical way should be a promising direction to investigate. We improve this situation by proposing a probability-based approach named StiCProb to capture source code fragments for feature concerned, which inherently provides a conditional probability to describe the closeness between two programming elements. In the case study, we conduct feature mining on several legacy systems, to compare our approach with other related approaches. As demonstrated in our experiment, our approach could support developers to locate features within legacy successfully with a better performance of 83{\%} for precision and 41{\%} for recall. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The evolution of Software Product Lines (SPL) is challenging because stakeholders have to deal with both regular evolution and the co-existence of different products. Our focus of product evolution is on the tasks integrators have to perform to update deployed SPL products with minimal interruption of services. In case of Egemin, our industrial partner, the updates of SPL products is further hampered as a consequence of outdated and imprecise architectural knowledge of deployed products. To facilitate the updates of products, we have developed the architecture-centric approach which comprises two complementary parts: an update viewpoint and a supporting tool. In this paper we present an evaluation of the architecturecentric approach. The approach is compared with the Egemin's current update approach in a controlled experiment. In the experiment 17 professionals were asked to perform 68 updates of logistic systems. The results obtained from the experiment show that the architecture-centric approach significantly improves the correctness of updates and reduces the interruption of services during updates of Egemin's SPL products. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {In SOA, reusability logic is divided into services to support reuse. However, SOA lacks support for systematic reusability of Web services or composite Web services, making it more difficult to reuse them in mass production environments. On the other hand, SPL engineering supports systematic reuse by selecting the features that are part of a product while removing others that are not part of it. We propose a method in which SPL features are used to represent Web services and composite Web services. As a result, the selection or deselection of reusable features in a feature model guide the construction of particular service compositions. We have validated our approach based on a case study. Results related to systematic reuse demonstrate the value of our method. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Software product line (SPL) testing is a tougher work than testing of single systems. Still testing of each individual SPL product would be perfect but it is too costly in practice. In fact, when the number of features increases then the number of possible products also increases exponentially usually derived from a feature model. Number of features is leading to thousands of different products. Due to cost and time constraints, it is infeasible or large number of effort to run all the test cases in an existing test suite. To decrease the cost of testing, various techniques have been proposed. One of them is test case prioritization (TCP) techniques. Here we presented a survey for TCP techniques for software SPL. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

New Variability Model and Management Functions to process its element are proposed as this process Core. The model consistently represents variabilities both in PL structure and artefacts across all PL development stages and stakeholders' viewpoints along with the dedicated assessment submodel. The functions compose separate actions as to variability into the single cycle like Doeming Plan-Do-Check-Act one where decisions should be rational. Presented successful Case Study purposes at the Core proposed testing along with the dedicated Configurator implemented in instrumental and technological complex just developed in the Institute of Software Systems of NAS.},

  abstract  = {In an information system ecosystem customers integrate features, which are independently developed and evolved by multiple organizations. These features need to work together although there is little to no coordination among developer organizations. The handling of such ecosystems becomes the more challenging, the more the solutions provided by the different parties are intertwined. In this paper, we propose to handle implementations on a per-feature basis, and introduce an approach towards this goal, which we call feature packs. We discuss the requirements on such an approach and emphasize in particular the kind of analysis relevant to ensure that the system resulting from a corresponding aggregation of feature packs works reliably. We also illustrate a realization of the approach using a real-world ecosystem case study. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

However, since mobile applications become more and more complex, increased code reuse and thus reduced time-to-market play an important role, which can be improved by software product lines. We propose five architectural styles for developing software product lines of Android apps: (1) activity extensions, (2) activity connectors, (3) dynamic preference entries, (4) decoupled definition of domain-specific behavior via configuration files, (5) feature model using Android resources. We demonstrate the benefits in an early case study using an image processing product line which enables more than 90{\%} of code reuse. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

They aim at planning, developing, and configuring systems by describing configuration knowledge at different levels of formality. The existence of large models using a variety of modeling concepts in heterogeneous languages with intricate semantics calls for a unified measuring approach. In this position paper, we attempt to take a first step towards such a measurement. We discuss perspectives of metrics, define low-level measurement goals, and conceive and implement metrics based on variability modeling concepts found in real-world languages and models. An evaluation of these metrics with real-world models and codebases provides insight into the benefits of such metrics for the defined perspectives. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

  abstract  = {Model driven approaches are shifting software development from a code based activity to a model based activity. Models can be refined and transformed from requirements into code specific to a platform. Although several model transformations can occur, they usually take place at a single development stage. In the case of software product lines, and particularly of software factories, the modeling of a system can occur at several stages, for instance, at the software-house, at the systems integrator and at the final customer site. Basically, this requires that the model used at a particular stage can be refined at the next stage. In this paper, we explore the issues related to such an approach and we propose model transformation patterns that can be generically applied to models so that they can be used in multi-staged modeling approaches. We show how to realize the approach with the Eclipse Modeling Framework and present an insurance case study. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Software product line engineering (SPLE) [5] seeks to exploit the commonalities among systems from a given problem domain while managing the variabilities among them in a systematic way. In SPLE, new system variants can be rapidly created based on a set of reusable assets, such as a common architecture, components, and models. Generative software development [6] aims at modeling and implementing product lines in such a way that a given system can be automatically generated from a specification written in one or more textual or graphical domain-specific languages (DSLs) [13, 4, 15, 8, 3, 1, 12, 14]. In this tutorial, participants will learn how to perform (1) domain analysis, i.e., capturing the commonalities and variabilities within a product line using, among others, feature modeling, (2) domain design, i.e., developing a common architecture for a product line, and (3) implementing software generators using multiple technologies, such as template-based code generation and model transformations. I will describe recent progress in feature modeling, including staged configuration [9], constraint support for feature modeling and configuration [10, 2], and feature models as views on ontologies [11]. Furthermore, I will survey and compare available tools for feature modeling and implementing DSLs as well as related approaches such as Software Factories and Model-Driven Architecture. Among others, I will demonstrate tool support for mapping features to UML models and model configuration [7]. The presented concepts and methods will be explained using a sample case study of an e-commerce platform. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {When people make interventions to a system they expect the effects to be nearly instantaneous. Unfortunately, in most of the cases the intervention intended to improve the process actually causes outcomes to get worse before they get better, if they get better at all. The challenge in these types of situations is being able to readjust expectations that there is a delay in the improvement. This is not simply a case of learning curve where people get better by performing repetitive tasks over time. What we are describing is a delay in the improvement and, in some cases, a degradation of performance. In this paper we discuss why humans tend to underestimate such delays in process improvement across a variety of circumstances. To illustrate this, we compare data collected from a survey with three well-documented scenarios of process improvement: the implementation of a preventative maintenance program at DuPont, the modification of Tiger Woods' golf swing, and the implementation of a platform engineering initiative for the embedded software product line at Rolls-Royce. We discuss potential reasons for the chronic underestimation of these types of improvements and recommend mechanisms for making these estimates more realistic. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

SPLE is intended to develop a set of similar software systems which share great commonalities within a particular application domain. There are two key assets underpin Software Product Line (SPL) development: feature model and reference architecture. To deal with complex crosscutting behaviors in SPL and also manage the impact of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), we propose an aspect-oriented framework in this paper. The proposed framework is able to improve the modeling of interrelationships between design factors and representation of the variabilities in product families. We introduce a small case study to illustrate our approach at the end.},

Stereotype-based Management of Variability (SMarty) is one of the several approaches to manage variabilities specified in UML diagrams. SMarty, in its fourth version, supports variability management specification in use case, class, activity and components diagrams. However, it lacked the representation of dynamic aspects of a SPL. The inclusion of UML interaction diagrams in the core assets allows the representation of an important abstraction level. Therefore, this paper presents a proposal for extending SMarty to manage variabilities in UML sequence diagrams. In addition, it presents an experimental validation that provides evidences of the effectiveness of this extension which supports its use both in academic and industrial environment. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

While software product lines (SPLs), often in combination with feature modelling, are already well established in the domain of information systems, up to now SPLs are rarely used in the domain of aPS. Also, SPLs for aPS need to include variants and versions in mechanic and electric besides software leading to interdisciplinary product lines (IPLs). In this paper an existing approach of an IPL is enhanced with extended feature modelling methods and SPLs and, subsequently, applied to two industrial case studies - one in special purpose machinery and the other in plant manufacturing.

In order to present this variability management, we focus on the diagnostic domain, a special case of Decision Support Systems. A generic solution for the automatic construction of systems of this kind is given using our approach: Baseline Oriented Modeling (BOM).},

Variant management is a cross-cutting concern that has interaction points with many of those integrated solutions. At Bosch, two different tools are used for variant management: pure::variants, a feature modeling tool for describing the feature-oriented product decomposition, and the custom tool MIC that offers a more comprehensive set of fine-grained variability management mechanisms. These include parameters, automated configurations or constraints. In turn, it is more suitable for component selection that is done close to the technology. In this experience report, we present a methodological approach on how to use the two tools with a technical integration solution we developed. Its purpose is to serve as an example for establishing successful variant management in large-scale product lines with respect to methodology and tools.},

One of the main tasks conducted during the SPLE process is Variability Management (VM). VM is about identifying commonality among the different products being developed while capturing and cataloging variability. In real-life projects, VM models tend to encompass a very large number of variants reaching in many projects the order of thousands. Visualizing these models has been a major challenge for tool developers. In this work, we present our MUSA CASE tool which uses hyperbolic trees for representing VM models and supports gesture based interaction (using multi-touch interfaces). The tool has been successfully used to develop a large scale case study.},

However, determining the memory characteristics of individual features and product variants is extremely challenging. We present an approach that supports the monitoring of memory characteristics of individual features at the level of Java virtual machines. Our approach provides extensions to Java virtual machines to track memory allocations and deal-locations of individual features based on a feature-to-code mapping. The approach enables continuous monitoring at the level of features to detect anomalies such as memory leaks, excessive memory consumption, or abnormal garbage collection times in product variants. We provide an evaluation of our approach based on different product variants of the DesktopSearcher product line. Our experiment with different program inputs demonstrates the feasibility of our technique. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

The paper first starts by discussing the needs of the FTI community and the specific functional requirements of software. These include the ability to fit in with legacy systems, the ability to handle many tens of thousands of parameters, support for new networked-based technologies and support for hardware from any vendor. The non-functional requirements of FTI orientated software are also described and it is suggested that the key non-functional requirements include testability, modifiability, extensibility and maintainability. Finally, as a case study, the X-Tools from ACRA CONTROL are presented. The paper discusses their design, and the tactics used to meet the functional and non-functional requirements of the FTI industry. The paper then outlines how the rigorous quality standards were met and describes the specific mechanisms used to verify the quality of the software. {\textcopyright} International Foundation for Telemetering, 2010.},

Since the first systems using design rationale in the seventies and eighties to the more modern approaches using {\{}AK{\}} for designing software architectures, a variety of models, approaches, and research tools have leveraged the interests of researchers and practitioners in {\{}AK{\}} management (AKM). Capturing, sharing, and using {\{}AK{\}} has many benefits for software designers and maintainers, but the cost to capture this relevant knowledge hampers a widespread use by software companies. However, as the improvements made over the last decade didn't boost a wider adoption of {\{}AKM{\}} approaches, there is a need to identify the successes and shortcomings of current {\{}AK{\}} approaches and know what industry needs from AK. Therefore, as researchers and promoters of many of the {\{}AK{\}} research tools in the early stages where {\{}AK{\}} became relevant for the software architecture community, and based on our experience and observations, we provide in this research an informal retrospective analysis of what has been done and the challenges and trends for a future research agenda to promote {\{}AK{\}} use in modern software development practices. },

Objective: This paper analyzes the literature on product lines from 1995 to 2014, identifying the most influential publications, the most researched topics, and how the interest in those topics has evolved along the way. Method: Bibliographic data have been gathered from {\{}ISI{\}} Web of Science and Scopus. The data have been examined using two prominent bibliometric approaches: science mapping and performance analysis. Results: According to the study carried out, (i) software architecture was the initial motor of research in SPL; (ii) work on systematic software reuse has been essential for the development of the area; and (iii) feature modeling has been the most important topic for the last fifteen years, having the best evolution behavior in terms of number of published papers and received citations. Conclusion: Science mapping has been used to identify the main researched topics, the evolution of the interest in those topics and the relationships among topics. Performance analysis has been used to recognize the most influential papers, the journals and conferences that have published most papers, how numerous is the literature on product lines and what is its distribution over time. },

Assuming dependencies between SPL application components and reference architecture implementation (a platform), this paper empirically investigates the relationship between 7 design metrics and changeability of 46 server components of a product line for business applications. In addition, we investigated the usefulness of Platform Responsibility (PR) metric as an indicator of product line component changeability. The results show that most of the design metrics are strongly related to the changeability of server component and also indicate statistically significant correlation between Maintainability Index (MI) and PR metric. The assessment is based on a case study of the implementation of the product line for business applications in a financial institution. The results show that PR metric can be used as good predictor of changeability in the software product line environment. {\textcopyright} 2014, University of Zagreb. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Context: This paper presents a novel experiment focused on detecting and analyzing clones in test suites written in TTCN-3, a standard telecommunication test script language, for different industrial projects. Objective: This paper investigates frequencies, types, and similarity distributions of TTCN-3 clones in test scripts from three industrial projects in telecommunication. We also compare the distribution of clones in TTCN-3 test scripts with the distribution of clones in C/C++ and Java projects from the telecommunication domain. We then perform a statistical analysis to validate the significance of differences between these distributions. Method: Similarity is computed using CLAN, which compares metrics syntactically derived from script fragments. Metrics are computed from the Abstract Syntax Trees produced by a TTCN-3 parser called Titan developed by Ericsson as an Eclipse plugin. Finally, clone classification of similar script pairs is computed using the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm on token types and token images. Results: This paper presents figures and diagrams reporting TTCN-3 clone frequencies, types, and similarity distributions. We show that the differences between the distribution of clones in test scripts and the distribution of clones in applications are statistically significant. We also present and discuss some lessons that can be learned about the transferability of technology from this study. Conclusion: About 24{\%} of fragments in the test suites are cloned, which is a very high proportion of clones compared to what is generally found in source code. The difference in proportion of Type-1 and Type-2 clones is statistically significant and remarkably higher in TTCN-3 than in source code. Type-1 and Type-2 clones represent 82.9{\%} and 15.3{\%} of clone fragments for a total of 98.2{\%}. Within the projects this study investigated, this represents more and easier potential re-factoring opportunities for test scripts than for code.},

  abstract = {Software architecture specifications are used for many different purposes, such as documenting architectural decisions, predicting architectural qualities before the system is implemented, and guiding the design and coding process. In these contexts, assessing the architectural model as early as possible becomes a relevant challenge. Various analysis techniques have been proposed for testing, model checking, and evaluating performance based on architectural models. Among them, model checking is an exhaustive and automatic verification technique, used to verify whether an architectural specification conforms to expected properties. While model checking is being extensively applied to software architectures, little work has been done to comprehensively enumerate and classify these different techniques. The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art in model checking software architectures. For this purpose, we first define the main activities in a model checking software architecture process. Then, we define a classification and comparison framework and compare model checking software architecture techniques according to it. },

  abstract = {Abstract Software Engineering provides mechanisms to design, develop, manage and maintain social and collaborative software systems. At present, the Software Engineering Curricula includes teaching Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) as a new paradigm that enables higher productivity, attempting to maximize compatibility between systems. Modern learning methods {\{}MDE{\}} require the use of practical approaches to analyze new model-transformation techniques. Model transformations are carried out by using very high-level languages, like the {\{}ATL{\}} language. This model transformation language is built as a plugin for the Eclipse framework, and users who want to collaborate and develop software with it, have some difficulties executing {\{}ATL{\}} transformations outside this platform. To handle models at runtime, it is interesting to perform the transformations in a standalone way. In this context, we have developed a testbed web tool which aims to be useful for learning model transformation techniques. The tool offers a Graphical User Interface to test and verify the involved model transformations. The proposal is useful as a collaborative scenario for learning {\{}MDE{\}} and model transformation issues and techniques in Software Engineering education. },

  abstract = {Context Several large software-developing organizations have adopted Open Source Software development (OSSD) practices to develop in-house components that are subsequently integrated into products. This phenomenon is also known as âInner Sourceâ. While there have been several reports of successful cases of this phenomenon, little is known about the challenges that practitioners face when integrating software that is developed in such a setting. Objective The objective of this study was to shed light on challenges related to building products with components that have been developed within an Inner Source development environment. Method Following an initial systematic literature review to generate seed category data constructs, we performed an in-depth exploratory case study in an organization that has a significant track record in the implementation of Inner Source. Data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with participants from a range of divisions across the organization. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative data analysis techniques. Results We have identified a number of challenges and approaches to address them, and compared the findings to challenges related to development with {\{}OSS{\}} products reported in the literature. We found that many challenges identified in the case study could be mapped to challenges related to integration of OSS. Conclusion The results provide important insights into common challenges of developing with {\{}OSS{\}} and Inner Source and may help organizations to understand how to improve their software development practices by adopting certain {\{}OSSD{\}} practices. The findings also identify the areas that need further research. },

  abstract = {Software traceability is the ability to provide trace information on requirements, design, and implementation of a system. It helps stakeholders understand the many associations of software artifacts created during a software development project. End-to-end traceability refers to linkage of all artifacts in the entire lifecycle of a software development project. Its goal is to provide stakeholders of the software development with trace information in order to analyze impacts due to changes in a software system. Compared to that of a single product, the end-to-end traceability of software product line is more complicated because Software Product Line Development (SPLD) requires two separate but intimately related phases of domain engineering and application engineering. Various SPLD traceability approaches have been proposed in the past. However, thus far no research work on SPLD traceability has focused on SPLD end-to-end traceability. This paper defines SPLD end-to-end traceability and evaluates the existing SPLD traceability approaches from SPLD end-to-end traceability perspectives. We surveyed studies on SPLD traceability methods, traceability mechanisms used in major SPLD approaches, and software traceability survey papers. We compared the existing SPLD traceability approaches based on Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Through the survey, we found that none of the SPLD traceability studies fully supports SPLD end-to-end traceability, and there are unexplored research areas of SPLD end-to-end traceability in the existing SPLD traceability studies. The contribution of this paper is that it presents future research directions that give research guidelines for each unexplored research area in SPLD end-to-end traceability. Finally, based on the research directions, this paper suggests future research opportunities for SPLD end-to-end traceability. {\textcopyright} 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

However, there are still some problems exist within the concept itself, such as variability and commonality. Due to its variability, exhaustive testing is not possible. Various solutions have been proposed to lessen this problem. One of them is prioritization technique, in which it is used to arrange back the test cases to achieve a specific performance goal. In this paper, the early fault detection is selected as the performance goal. Similarity function is used within our prioritization approach. Five different types of prioritization techniques are used in the experiment. The experiment results indicate that the greed-aided-clustering ordered sequence (GOS) shows the highest rate of early fault detection.},

  abstract = {AbstractContext Computation Independent Model (CIM) as a business model describes the requirements and environment of a business system and instructs the designing and development; it is a key to influencing software success. Although many studies currently focus on model driven development (MDD); those researches, to a large extent, study the PIM-level and PSM-level model, and few have dealt with CIM-level modelling for case in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete. Objective This paper proposes a CIM-level modelling approach, which applies a stepwise refinement approach to modelling the CIM-level model starting from a high-level goal model to a lower-level business process model. A key advantage of our approach is the combination of the requirement model with the business model, which helps software engineers to define business models exactly for cases in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete. Method This paper, based on the model driven approach, proposes a set of models at the CIM-level and model transformations to connect these models. Accordingly, the formalisation approach of this paper involves formalising the goal model using the category theory and the scenario model and business process model using Petri nets. Results We have defined a set of metamodels and transformation rules making it possible to obtain automatically a scenario model from the goal model and a business process model from the scenario model. At the same time, we have defined a mapping rule to formalise these models. Our proposed {\{}CIM{\}} modelling approach and formalisation approach are implemented with an {\{}MDA{\}} tool, and it has been empirically validated by a travel agency case study. Conclusion This study shows how a {\{}CIM{\}} modelling approach helps to build a complete and consistent model at the {\{}CIM{\}} level for cases in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete in advance. },

Using a reliable framework for migration ensures managers to mitigate risks in the cloud computing technology. Therefore, organizations always search for cloud migration frameworks with dynamic nature as well as integrity beside their simplicity. In previous studies, these important features have received less attention and have not been achieved in an integrated and comprehensive way. The aim of this study is to use a meta-synthesis method for the first time for analysis and synthesis of previous published studies and suggests a comprehensive cloud migration framework. We review more than 657 papers from relevant journals and conference proceedings. The concepts which are extracted from these papers are classified to related sub-categories and categories. Then, our proposed framework based on these concepts and categories is developed. It includes seven main phases (categories) and fifteen sub-categories. To improve the migration process a maturity model called âClM3â is introduced. Finally, proposed framework and maturity model is evaluated by forming different focus group meetings and taking advantages of the cloud experts' opinion. The results of this research can help managers have a safe and effective migration to cloud computing environment. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Developing secure software systems is an issue of ever-growing importance. Researchers have generally come to acknowledge that to develop such systems successfully, their security features must be incorporated in the context of a systematic approach: a security methodology. There are a number of such methodologies in the literature, but no single security methodology is adequate for every situation, requiring the construction of âfit-to-purposeâ methodologies or the tailoring of existing methodologies to the project specifics at hand. While a large body of research exists addressing the same requirement for development methodologies â constituting the field of Method Engineering â there is nothing comparable for security methodologies as such; in fact, the topic has never been studied before in such a context. Objective In this paper we draw inspiration from a number of Method Engineering ideas and fill the latter gap by proposing a comprehensive approach to engineering security methodologies. Method Our approach is embodied in three interconnected parts: a framework of interrelated security process patterns; a security-specific meta-model; and a meta-methodology to guide engineers in using the latter artefacts in a step-wise fashion. A UML-inspired notation is used for representing all pattern-based methodology models during design and construction. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by tailoring an existing, real-life security methodology to a distributed-system-specific project situation. Results The paper proposes a novel pattern-oriented approach to modeling, constructing, tailoring and combining security methodologies, which is the very first and currently sole such approach in the literature. We illustrate and evaluate our approach in an academic setting, and perform a feature analysis to highlight benefits and deficiencies. Conclusion Using our proposal, developers, architects and researchers can analyze and engineer security methodologies in a structured, systematic fashion, taking into account all security methodology aspects. },

For a given specification, we can get many possible implementations; choosing one implementation from this is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we extend the work on analyzing software product lines to propose a cost effective approach that fetches products from a given SPL based on various factors. When there are multiple implementations for a given specification, then it is the cost factors which determine the product selection. To this end, we propose a revised formal framework for SPLs with cost factors. This approach has been implemented in a tool SPLANE-CF (SPL Analysis Engine with Cost Factors).

The overall functionality of smart products is a combination of mechanical, electrical/electronic functions (hardware functions) and software functions. For hardware and software there are different lifecycle models: Product lifecycle management (PLM) focuses on hardware, application lifecycle management (ALM) focuses on software. Smart products force manufacturers to converge both lifecycle models step by step. Although seemingly important, the research community leaves this innovative area mostly up to the {\{}PLM{\}} tool vendors and the {\{}ALM{\}} tool vendors, resulting in them driving the convergence. This paper points out the mismatch between industry and academia regarding the PLM/ALM convergence. We encourage academia to increase research activities and we propose potential research topics. },

In order to maximize the success of a product, the customers' wishes need to be integrated into the entire product design process. The design of a mechatronic system can be divided in a 3 different phases, requirements engineering, architectural design and detailed design. During the requirement phase, customers needs are translated into engineering characteristics. In the architectural phase, the topology, consisting of the number and type of components, as well as some key properties (size, material) of the different components, is chosen. This phase has a major impact on the final product performance. Since (mechatronic) products need to meet an ever increasing number of performance specifications and constraints, recently computational design synthesis approaches have been developed to support design engineers. These types of methods use computational power and computer models to search the design space in an automatic way. However, as these methods focus entirely on maximizing the functional performance, the customers' actual wishes and needs may slip to the background. This article presents a novel computational design synthesis approach which integrates design space exploration and Quality Function Deployment during the architectural design phase. The proposed method allows to generate architectures that maximize customer satisfaction. The effectiveness is illustrated by an industrial case study: the design of the mechanical architecture for a washing machine.},

In this context, we address issues related to the dynamic composition of such code elements (i.e. how they are dynamically plugged together) as well as their collaboration (i.e. how they work together). We also consider the limitation of build-level dependencies, to avoid the entire re-compilation and re-deployment of a software when modifying it or integrating new functionalities. To solve these issues, we propose a new design pattern coupling role and component concepts and illustrate its relevance for medical software. Compared to most related works focusing on few role concepts while ignoring others, the proposed pattern integrates many role concepts as first-class entities, including in particular a refinement of the notion of collaboration. Another significant contribution of our proposal concerns the coupling of role and component concepts. Roles are related to the functional aspects of a target software program (composition and collaboration of functional units). Components correspond to the physical distribution of code elements with limited build-level dependencies. As illustrated in this paper, such a coupling enables to instantiate a software program using a generic main program together with a description file focusing on software functionalities only. Related code elements are transparently retrieved and composed at run-time before appropriately collaborating, regardless the specificity of their distribution over components. },

However, constructs aimed to support crosscutting modularity might actually break class modularity. As a consequence, class developers face changeability, parallel development and comprehensibility problems, because they must be aware of aspects whenever they develop or maintain a class. At the same time, aspects are vulnerable to changes in classes, since there is no contract specifying the points of interaction amongst these elements. These problems can be mitigated by using adequate design rules between classes and aspects. We present a design rule specification language and explore its benefits since the initial phases of the development process, specially with the aim of supporting modular development of classes and aspects. We discuss how our language improves crosscutting modularity without breaking class modularity. We evaluate it using a real case study and compare it with other approaches. },

Game development is considered as one of the most complex tasks in software engineering. The increased popularity of digital games, the challenges faced by game development organizations in developing quality games, and high competition in the digital game industry demand a game development maturity assessment. Consequently, this study presents a Digital Game Maturity Model to evaluate the current development methodology in an organization. The framework of this model consists of assessment questionnaires, a performance scale, and a rating method. The main goal of the questionnaires is to collect information about current processes and practices. In general, this research contributes towards formulating a comprehensive and unified strategy for game development maturity evaluation. Two case studies were conducted and their assessment results reported. These demonstrate the level of maturity of current development practices in two organizations. },

Mathematics is also shown to improve understandability, reusability and maintainability through modelling software modules as finite state machines. The proposed methodology includes explicit traceability between requirements, design, implementation and test cases. Traceability improves the verification of completeness and consistency and it allows for proper change management. To improve the reliability of PMGT, given the challenge that the correct solution is unknown a priori, an automated testing approach is adopted to verify the known properties of a correct solution, such as conformality and counterclockwise vertex numbering. },

  abstract = {Abstract Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a software engineering paradigm that uses models as main assets in all development phases. While many languages for model manipulation exist (e.g., for model transformation or code generation), there is a lack of frameworks to define and apply model mutations. A model mutant is a variation of an original model, created by the application of specific model mutation operations. Model mutation has many applications, for instance, in the areas of model transformation testing, model-based testing or education. In this paper, we present a domain-specific language called Wodel for the specification and generation of model mutants. Wodel is domain-independent, as it can be used to generate mutants of models conformant to arbitrary meta-models. Its development environment is extensible, permitting the incorporation of post-processors for different applications. In particular, we describe Wodel-Edu, a post-processing extension directed to the automated generation of exercises for particular domains and their automated correction. We show the application of Wodel-Edu to the generation of exercises for deterministic automata, and report on an evaluation of the quality of the generated exercises, obtaining overall good results. },

In this approach, a feature model is usually used to keep track of similarities and differences. Over time, as modifications are made to the SPL, inconsistencies with the feature model could arise. The first approach to dealing with these inconsistencies is refactoring. Refactoring consists of small steps which, when accumulated, may lead to large-scale changes in the SPL, resulting in features being added to or eliminated from the SPL. In this paper, we propose a framework for refactoring SPLs, which helps keep SPLs consistent with the feature model. After some introductory remarks, we describe a formal model for representing the feature model. We express various refactoring patterns applicable to the feature model and the SPL formally, and then introduce an algorithm for finding them in the SPL. In the end, we use a real-world case study of an SPL to illustrate the applicability of the framework introduced in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Abstract The number of programming languages is large and steadily increasing. However, little structured information and empirical evidence is available to help software engineers assess the suitability of a language for a particular development project or software architecture. We argue that these shortages are partly due to a lack of high-level, objective programming language feature assessment criteria: existing advice to practitioners is often based on ill-defined notions of âparadigms' [3, p. xiii] and âorientation', while researchers lack a shared common basis for generalisation and synthesis of empirical results. This paper presents a feature model constructed from the programmer's perspective, which can be used to precisely compare general-purpose programming languages in the actor-oriented, agent-oriented, functional, object-oriented, and procedural categories. The feature model is derived from the existing literature on general concepts of programming, and validated with concrete mappings of well-known languages in each of these categories. The model is intended to act as a tool for both practitioners and researchers, to facilitate both further high-level comparative studies of programming languages, and detailed investigations of feature usage and efficacy in specific development contexts. },

  abstract = {Role-based access control (RBAC) is a popular access control model for enterprise systems due to its flexibility and scalability. There are many {\{}RBAC{\}} features available, each providing a different function. Not all features are needed for an {\{}RBAC{\}} system. Depending on the requirements, one should be able to configure features on a need basis, which reduces development complexity and thus fosters development. However, there have not been suitable methods that enable systematic configuration of {\{}RBAC{\}} features for system development. This paper presents an approach for configuring {\{}RBAC{\}} features using a combination of feature modeling and {\{}UML{\}} modeling. Feature modeling is used for capturing the structure of features and configuration rules, and {\{}UML{\}} modeling is used for defining the semantics of features. {\{}RBAC{\}} features are defined based on design principles of partial inheritance and compatibility, which facilitates feature composition and verification. We demonstrate the approach using a banking application and present tool support developed for the approach. },

  abstract = {Abstract The optimization of a Product Line Architecture (PLA) design can be modeled as a multi-objective problem, influenced by many factors, such as feature modularization, extensibility and other design principles. Due to this it has been properly solved in the Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. However, previous empirical studies optimized {\{}PLA{\}} design using the multi-objective and evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II, without applying one of the most important genetic operators: the crossover. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a feature-driven crossover operator that aims at improving feature modularization in {\{}PLA{\}} design. The proposed operator was applied in two empirical studies using NSGA-II in comparison with another version of NSGA-II that uses only mutation operators. The results show the usefulness and applicability of the proposed operator. The NSGA-II version that applies the feature-driven crossover found a greater diversity of solutions (potential {\{}PLA{\}} designs), with higher feature-based cohesion, and less feature scattering and tangling. },

One of the goals of adopting {\{}SO{\}} is the improvement of reusability, however, the development of service-based system in practice has uncovered several challenging issues, such as how to identify reusable services, how to determine configurations of services that are relevant to users' current product configuration and context, and how to maintain service validity after configuration changes. In this paper, we propose a method that addresses these issues by adapting a feature-oriented product line engineering approach. The method is notable in that it guides developers to identify reusable services at the right level of granularity and to map users' context to relevant service configuration, and it also provides a means to check the validity of services at runtime in terms of invariants and pre/post-conditions of services. Moreover, we propose a heterogeneous style based architecture model for developing such systems. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext A Software Product Line is a set of software systems that are built from a common set of features. These systems are developed in a prescribed way and they can be adapted to fit the needs of customers. Feature models specify the properties of the systems that are meaningful to customers. A semantics that models the feature level has the potential to support the automatic analysis of entire software product lines. Objective The objective of this paper is to define a formal framework for Software Product Lines. This framework needs to be general enough to provide a formal semantics for existing frameworks like {\{}FODA{\}} (Feature Oriented Domain Analysis), but also to be easily adaptable to new problems. Method We define an algebraic language, called SPLA, to describe Software Product Lines. We provide the semantics for the algebra in three different ways. The approach followed to give the semantics is inspired by the semantics of process algebras. First we define an operational semantics, next a denotational semantics, and finally an axiomatic semantics. We also have defined a representation of the algebra into propositional logic. Results We prove that the three semantics are equivalent. We also show how {\{}FODA{\}} diagrams can be automatically translated into SPLA. Furthermore, we have developed our tool, called AT, that implements the formal framework presented in this paper. This tool uses a SAT-solver to check the satisfiability of an SPL. Conclusion This paper defines a general formal framework for software product lines. We have defined three different semantics that are equivalent; this means that depending on the context we can choose the most convenient approach: operational, denotational or axiomatic. The framework is flexible enough because it is closely related to process algebras. Process algebras are a well-known paradigm for which many extensions have been defined. },

The generic nature of reference architectures leads to a less defined architecture design and application contexts, which makes the architecture goal definition and architecture design non-trivial steps, rooted in uncertainty. Objective The paper presents a structured and comprehensive study on the congruence between context, goals, and design of software reference architectures. It proposes a tool for the design of congruent reference architectures and for the analysis of the level of congruence of existing reference architectures. Method We define a framework for congruent reference architectures. The framework is based on state of the art results from literature and practice. We validate our framework and its quality as analytical tool by applying it for the analysis of 24 reference architectures. The conclusions from our analysis are compared to the opinions of experts on these reference architectures documented in literature and dedicated communication. Results Our framework consists of a multi-dimensional classification space and of five types of reference architectures that are formed by combining specific values from the multi-dimensional classification space. Reference architectures that can be classified in one of these types have better chances to become a success. The validation of our framework confirms its quality as a tool for the analysis of the congruence of software reference architectures. Conclusion This paper facilitates software architects and scientists in the inception, design, and application of congruent software reference architectures. The application of the tool improves the chance for success of a reference architecture. },

  abstract = {Abstract Mobile Applications are rapidly emerging as a convenient medium for using a variety of services. Over time and with the high penetration of smartphones in society, self-adaptation has become an essential capability required by mobile application users. In an ideal scenario, an application is required to adjust its behavior according to the current context of its use. This raises the challenge in mobile computing towards the design and development of applications that sense and react to contextual changes to provide a value-added user experience. In its general sense, context information can relate to the environment, the user, or the device status. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for building context aware and adaptive mobile applications. Based on feature modeling and Software Product Lines (SPL) concepts, this framework guides the modeling of adaptability at design time and supports context awareness and adaptability at runtime. In the core of the approach, is a feature meta-model that incorporates, in addition to {\{}SPL{\}} concepts, application feature priorities to drive the adaptability. A tool, based on that feature model, is presented to model the mobile application features and to derive the {\{}SPL{\}} members. A mobile framework, built on top of {\{}OSGI{\}} framework to dynamically adapt the application at runtime is also described. },

However, current quality models to evaluate reusability do not adequately address the unique characteristics of core assets in PLE.

  abstract = {In model-driven engineering, evolution is inevitable over the course of the complete life cycle of complex software-intensive systems and more importantly of entire product families. Not only instance models, but also entire modelling languages are subject to change. This is in particular true for domain-specific languages, whose language constructs are tightly coupled to an application domain. The most popular approach to evolution in the modelling domain is a manual process, with tedious and error-prone migration of artefacts such as instance models as a result. This paper provides a taxonomy for evolution of modelling languages and discusses the different evolution scenarios for various kinds of modelling artefacts, such as instance models, meta-models, and transformation models. Subsequently, the consequences of evolution and the required remedial actions are decomposed into primitive scenarios such that all possible evolutions can be covered exhaustively. These primitives are then used in a high-level framework for the evolution of modelling languages. We suggest that our structured approach enables the design of (semi-)automatic modelling language evolution solutions. },

  abstract = {Abstract Interaction features of social web sites, including social networks and social media, enable a new kind of commerce referred to as social commerce (s-commerce). It refers to doing commerce in a collaborative and participative way, through a uniform and interactive enterprise interface, by extending current social web sites initially designed for social interactions of individuals, to promote new business models. On one hand, none of the major social networks or social media providers has yet figured out how to bring commercial transactions directly to their platforms. On the other hand, there is a lack of a comprehensive framework to shape social commerce from both business and {\{}IT{\}} perspectives, which would guide a design process of s-commerce platforms. Indeed, s-commerce platforms differ from e-commerce web sites in many aspects from both business and {\{}IT{\}} perspectives and has more challenges in terms of (i) business models, architectures, principles, and even theories, (ii) complex constructs in terms of participants, interaction features, communities, and content, and (iii) issues such as social, control, security, and privacy issues. Therefore, there is a need for framing the elements of s-commerce, focusing on enterprise social interactions as first class citizens, in an abstract model that guides the architecture, the requirement engineering, the design, and the implementation of a uniform and interactive enterprise interface. Only this enterprise social interaction-enabling interface would promote the emerging knowledge and intelligence that are required for value (co-) creation in s-commerce model. This work fills the gap by proposing a framework that guides a design process to develop s-commerce. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Advances in customization have highlighted the need for tools supporting variable content document management and generation in many domains. Current tools allow the generation of highly customized documents that are variable in both content and layout. However, most frameworks are technology-oriented, and their use requires advanced skills in implementation-related tools, which means their use by end users (i.e. document designers) is severely limited. Objective Starting from past and current trends for customized document authoring, our goal is to provide a document generation alternative in which variants are specified at a high level of abstraction and content reuse can be maximized in high variability scenarios. Method Based on our experience in Document Engineering, we identified areas in the variable content document management and generation field open to further improvement. We first classified the primary sources of variability in document composition processes and then developed a methodology, which we called {\{}DPL{\}} â based on Software Product Lines principles â to support document generation in high variability scenarios. Results In order to validate the applicability of our methodology we implemented a tool â {\{}DPLfw{\}} â to carry out {\{}DPL{\}} processes. After using this in different scenarios, we compared our proposal with other state-of-the-art tools for variable content document management and generation. Conclusion The {\{}DPLfw{\}} showed a good capacity for the automatic generation of variable content documents equal to or in some cases surpassing other currently available approaches. To the best of our knowledge, {\{}DPLfw{\}} is the only framework that combines variable content and document workflow facilities, easing the generation of variable content documents in which multiple actors play different roles. },

  abstract = {In EMF models, ordered collections appear as the values of multi-valued structural features. Traditional, text-based version control systems do not sufficiently support three-way merging of ordered collections inside EMF models since they cannot guarantee a consistent result. The operation three-way merging is defined as follows: based on a common base version b, two alternative versions a1 and a2 were developed by copying and modifying the base version. To reconcile these changes, a merged version m is to be created as a common successor of a1 and a2. In this paper, we present a graph algorithm to solve the problem of three-way merging of ordered collections in EMF models. Each version of a collection can be represented by means of a linearly ordered graph. To create the merged version, these graphs are combined to a merged collection graph using set formula. To create the merged collection, a generalized topological sort is performed on the merged collection graph. Conflicts occur in case the order of elements cannot be deduced automatically; these conflicts are resolved either interactively or by default rules. We have implemented the merge algorithm in our tool BTMerge, which performs a consistency-preserving three-way merge of versions of EMF models being instances of arbitrary Ecore models. Our implementation relies on an alternative form of representing multiple versions of a collection, namely a versioned collection graph which forms a superimposition of collection versions. The algorithm presented here is purely state-based. Matching and merging of collections are clearly separated sub-problems. Insertions and deletions performed on the elements of the collection are propagated into the merged version in a consistent way. Our algorithm makes only minimal assumptions with regard to the underlying product model and thus may be applied to ordered collections inside plain text or XML files. By taking arbitrary move operations into account, the algorithm considerably goes beyond the functionality of contemporary merge tools which cannot adequately handle move operations.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, context-awareness and adaptation have been receiving significant attention in many research areas. For application developers, the heterogeneity of resource-constrained mobile terminals creates serious problems for the development of mobile applications able to run properly on a large number of different devices. Thus, resource awareness plays a crucial role when developing such applications. It identifies the capability of being aware of the resources offered by an execution environment, in order to decide whether that environment is suited to receive and execute the application. Within this line of research, we propose Chameleon, a framework that provides both an integrated development environment and a proper context-aware support to adaptable Java applications for limited devices. In this paper we present the novel hybrid (from static to dynamic) analysis approach that Chameleon uses for inspecting (adaptable) Java programs with respect to their resource consumption in a given execution environment. This analysis permits to quantitatively compare alternative versions of the same program. The analysis is based on a resource model for specifying resource provisions and consumptions, and a parametric transition system that performs the actual analysis. },

  abstract = {Abstract Software product line (SPL) development is a new approach to software engineering which aims at the development of a whole range of products. However, as long as {\{}SPL{\}} can be useful, there are many challenges regarding the use of that approach. One of the main problems which hinders the adoption of software product line (SPL) is the complexity regarding product management. In that context, we can remark the scoping problem. One of the existent ways to deal with scoping is the product portfolio scoping (PPS). {\{}PPS{\}} aims to define the products that should be developed as well as their key features. In general, that approach is driven by marketing aspects, like cost of the product and customer satisfaction. Defining a product portfolio by using the many different available aspects is a NP-hard problem. This work presents an improved hybrid approach to solve the feature model selection problem, aiming at supporting product portfolio scoping. The proposal is based in a hybrid approach not dependent on any particular algorithm/technology. We have evaluated the usefulness and scalability of our approach using one real {\{}SPL{\}} (ArgoUML-SPL) and synthetic SPLs. As per the evaluation results, our approach is both useful from a practitioner's perspective and scalable. },

  abstract = {Generic programming is an effective methodology for developing reusable software libraries. Many programming languages provide generics and have features for describing interfaces, but none completely support the idioms used in generic programming. To address this need we developed the language G . The central feature of G is the concept, a mechanism for organizing constraints on generics that is inspired by the needs of modern C++ libraries. G provides modular type checking and separate compilation (even of generics). These characteristics support modular software development, especially the smooth integration of independently developed components. In this article we present the rationale for the design of G and demonstrate the expressiveness of G with two case studies: porting the Standard Template Library and the Boost Graph Library from C++ to G . The design of G shares much in common with the concept extension proposed for the next C++ Standard (the authors participated in its design) but there are important differences described in this article. },

A framework was developed in our research group to provide the necessary components and protocols for the development of adaptive Web systems; however, there were several issues and shortcomings (e.g. low productivity, lack of verification mechanisms, etc.) in using the framework that inspired the development of a domain-specific language for the framework. This paper focuses on the proposal, design, and implementation of AWL, the Adaptive Web Language, which is used to develop adaptive Web systems within our framework. Not only does AWL address the existing issues in the framework, but it also offers mechanisms to increase software quality attributes, especially, reusability. An example application named PENS (a personalized e-News system) is explained and implemented in AWL. AWL has been designed based on the analysis of the adaptive Web domain, having taken into account the principles of reuse-based software engineering (product-lines), domain-specific languages, and aspect-oriented programming. Specially, a novel design decision, inspired by aspect-oriented programming paradigm, allows separate specification of presentation features in an application from its adaptation features. The AWL's design decisions and their benefits are explained.},

  abstract = {Abstract Several researchers have identified the need to count on presence awareness in ubiquitous systems that support mobile activities, particularly when these systems are used to perform loosely-coupled mobile work. In such a work style, mobile users conduct face-to-face on-demand interactions, therefore counting on awareness information about the position and availability of potential collaborators becomes mandatory for these applications. Most proposed solutions that provide user presence awareness involve centralized components, have reusability limitations, or simply address a part of that service. This article presents a lightweight and fully distributed middleware named Moware, which allows developers to embed presence awareness services in mobile ubiquitous systems in a simple way. The article also describes the Moware architecture, its main components and strategies used to deal with several aspects of the presence awareness support. These design strategies can be reused by software designers to provide presence awareness capabilities into middleware and specific software applications. Moware services were embedded in a mobile ubiquitous system that supports inspectors during the construction inspection process. The preliminary results indicate that the middleware was easy to use for developers, and its services were useful for the end-users. },

  abstract      = {Software ecosystems is an emerging trend within the software industry, implying a shift from closed organizations and processes towards open structures, where actors external to the software development organization are becoming increasingly involved in development. This forms an ecosystem of organizations that are related through the shared interest in a software product, leading to new opportunities and new challenges to the industry and its organizational environment. To understand why and how this change occurs, we have followed the development of a software product line organization for a period of approximately five years. We have studied their change from a waterfall-like approach, via agile software product line engineering, towards an emerging software ecosystem. We discuss implications for practice, and propose a nascent theory on software ecosystems. We conclude that the observed change has led to an increase in collaboration across (previously closed) organizational borders, and to the development of a shared value consisting of two components: the technology (the product line, as an extensible platform), and the business domain it supports. Opening up both the technical interface of the product and the organizational interfaces are key enablers of such a change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A considerable part of the behavior in smart environments relies on event-driven and rule specification. Rules are the mechanism most often used to enable user customization of the environment. However, the expressiveness of the rules available to users in editing and other tools is usually either limited or the available rule editing interfaces are not designed for end-users with low skills in programming. This means we have to look for interaction techniques and new ways to define user customization rules. This paper describes a generic and flexible meta-model to support expressive rules enhanced with data flow expressions that will graphically support the definition of rules without writing code. An empirical study was conducted on the ease of understanding of the visual data flow expressions, which are the key elements in our rule proposal. The visual dataflow language was compared to its corresponding textual version in terms of comprehension and ease of learning by teenagers in exercises involving calculations, modifications, writing and detecting equivalences in expressions in both languages. Although the subjects had some previous experience in editing mathematical expressions on spreadsheets, the study found their performance with visual dataflows to be significantly better in calculation and modification exercises. This makes our dataflow approach a promising mechanism for expressing user-customized reactive behavior in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments. The performance of the rule matching processor was validated by means of two stress tests to ensure that the meta-model approach adopted would be able to scale up with the number of types and instances in the space. },

  abstract = {Context: Due to increased competition and the advent of mass customization, many software firms are utilizing product families - groups of related products derived from a product platform - to provide product variety in a cost-effective manner. The key to designing a successful software product family is the product platform, so it is important to determine the most appropriate product platform scope related to business objectives, for product line development.
Aim: This paper proposes a novel method to find the optimized scope of a software product platform based on end-user features.
Method: The proposed method, PPSMS (Product Platform Scoping Method for Software Product Lines), mathematically formulates the product platform scope selection as an optimization problem. The problem formulation targets identification of an optimized product platform scope that will maximize life cycle cost savings and the amount of commonality, while meeting the goals and needs of the envisioned customers' segments. A simulated annealing based algorithm that can solve problems heuristically is then used to help the decision maker in selecting a scope for the product platform, by performing tradeoff analysis of the commonality and cost savings objectives.
Results In a case study, PPSMS helped in identifying 5 non-dominated solutions considered to be of highest preference for decision making, taking into account both cost savings and commonality objectives. A quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated that human experts perceived value in adopting the method in practice, and that it was effective in identifying appropriate product platform scope. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In order to prevent accidents, coordinate rescue operations and warn people about critical events, this process imposes end-to-end delay constraints. Accordingly, the delay from each source to each destination should be monitored. For this purpose, a middleware is required between the network and the applications, offering the tracking capabilities of disseminated information. In this paper, we propose a middleware architecture for disseminating delay-constrained information in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In order to evaluate the feasibility of such architecture, a proof of concept of a real scenario is implemented. For performance evaluation, the end-to-end delay and the percentage of success related to the disseminated information are analyzed. Such analysis reveals that the middleware offers a percentage of success close to 98{\%}, which is highly superior to the success of individual resources, such as Short Message Services (SMS), emailing and twitter. },

Objective: We studied the interaction of stakeholders with issue-based modeling to evaluate its applicability in requirements engineering teams. Furthermore, we evaluated the reuse of rationale while instantiating and changing variability. Approach: We enriched a quasi-experimental design with a variety of methods found in case study research. A sample of 258 students was employed with data collection and analysis based on a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our study was performed in two phases: the first phase focused on variability identification and instantiation, while the second phase included tasks on variability evolution. Results: We obtained strong empirical evidence on reuse patterns for rationale during instantiation and evolution of variability. The tabular representations used by rationale modeling are learnable and usable in teams of diverse backgrounds. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Traceability between artifacts involved in the development of software product line (SPL) is still more critical because it is nec- essary to guarantee that the selection of variants that realize the different SPL products meet the requirements. Current SPL traceability mechanisms trace from variability in features to variations in the configuration of product-line architecture (PLA) in terms of adding and removing components. However, it is not always possible to mate- rialize the variable features of a SPL through adding or removing components, since sometimes they are materi- alized inside components, i.e., in part of their functionality: a class, a service, and/or an interface. Additionally, varia- tions that happen inside components may crosscut several components of architecture. These kinds of variations are still challenging and their traceability is not currently well supported. Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee that those SPL products with these kinds of variations meet the requirements. This paper presents a solution for tracing variability from features to PLA by taking these kinds of variations into account. This solution is based on models and traceability between models in order to automate SPL configuration by selecting the variants and realizing the product application. The FPLA modeling framework sup- ports this solution which has been deployed in a software factory. Validation has consisted in putting the solution into practice to develop a product line of power metering management applications for smart grids.},

Such objectives are achieved with a continuous share of the programmers' daily working life that inevitably influences the programmers' job satisfaction. One of the major challenges in process management is to determine the causes of this satisfaction. Traditional research models job satisfaction with social aspects of collaborative work like communication, work sustainability, and work environment. This study reflects on existing models of job satisfaction in collaborative environments, creates one for modern software development processes, and validates it with a retrospective comparative survey run on a sample of 108 respondents. In addition, the work investigates the impact on job satisfaction and its model of the agile practice of Pair Programming that pushes job sharing to the extreme. With this intent, the questionnaire also collected feedback from pair programmers whose responses were used for a comparative analysis. The results demonstrate that Pair Programming has actually a strong positive effect on satisfaction, work sustainability, and communication. },

Royer, âAutomated reasoning for derivation of modeldriven spls,â in SPLC'10 MAPLE'10, 2010, pp. 181â188] for working with self-adaptation infrastructures in order to provide automated reasoning on the dynamic creation of structural adaptation plans. We use a running example to demonstrate the applicability of such model, even in situations where complex interactions arise between context elements and the target self-adaptive enterprise application. },

  abstract = {Context The success of modern software distributions in the Free and Open Source world can be explained, among other factors, by the availability of a large collection of software packages and the possibility to easily install and remove those components using state-of-the-art package managers. However, package managers are often built using a monolithic architecture and hard-wired and ad-hoc dependency solvers implementing some customized heuristics. Objective We aim at laying the foundation for improving on existing package managers. Package managers should be complete, that is find a solution whenever there exists one, and allow the user to specify complex criteria that define how to pick the best solution according to the user's preferences. Method In this paper we propose a modular architecture relying on precise interface formalisms that allows the system administrator to choose from a variety of dependency solvers and backends. Results We have built a working prototypeâcalled MPMâfollowing the design advocated in this paper, and we show how it largely outperforms a variety of current package managers. Conclusion We argue that a modular architecture, allowing for delegating the task of constraint solving to external solvers, is the path that leads to the next generation of package managers that will deliver better results, offer more expressive preference languages, and be easily adaptable to new platforms. },

While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change.},

  abstract = {Abstract The aim of incremental analysis is, given a program, its analysis results, and a series of changes to the program, to obtain the new analysis results as efficiently as possible and, ideally, without having to (re-)analyze fragments of code which are not affected by the changes. Incremental analysis can significantly reduce both the time and the memory requirements of analysis. The first contribution of this article is a multi-domain incremental fixed-point algorithm for a sequential Java-like language. The algorithm is multi-domain in the sense that it interleaves the (re-)analysis for multiple domains by taking into account dependencies among them. Importantly, this allows the incremental analyzer to invalidate only those analysis results previously inferred by certain dependent domains. The second contribution is an incremental resource usage analysis which, in its first phase, uses the multi-domain incremental fixed-point algorithm to carry out all global pre-analyses required to infer cost in an interleaved way. Such resource analysis is parametric on the cost metrics one wants to measure (e.g., number of executed instructions, number of objects created, etc.). Besides, we present a novel form of cost summaries which allows us to incrementally reconstruct only those components of cost functions affected by the changes. Experimental results in the costa system show that the proposed incremental analysis provides significant performance gains, ranging from a speedup of 1.48 up to 5.13 times faster than non-incremental analysis. },

  abstract = {Abstract As the number and diversity of technologies involved in building enterprise systems continues to grow so does the importance of modeling tools that are able to present customized views of enterprise systems to different stakeholders according to their needs and skills. Moreover, since the range of required view types is continuously evolving, it must be possible to extend and enhance the languages and services offered by such tools on an ongoing basis. However, this can be difficult with today×³s modeling tools because the meta-models that define the languages, views and services they support are usually hardwired and thus not amenable to extensions. In practice, therefore, various workarounds have to be used to extend a tool×³s underlying meta-model. Some of these are built into the implemented modeling standards (e.g. {\{}UML{\}} 2, {\{}BPMN{\}} 2.0 and ArchiMate 2.0) while others have to be applied by complementary, external tools (e.g. annotation models). These techniques not only increase accidental complexity, they also reduce the ability of the modeling tool to ensure adherence to enterprise rules and constraints. In this paper we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches for language extension and propose a modeling framework best able to support the main extension scenarios currently found in practice today. },

However, the use of such algorithms can be a hard task for the software engineer, mainly due to the significant range of parameter and algorithm choices. To help in this task, the use of Hyper-heuristics is recommended. Hyper-heuristics can select or generate low-level heuristics while optimization algorithms are executed, and thus can be generically applied. Despite their benefits, we find only a few works using hyper-heuristics in the {\{}SBSE{\}} field. Considering this fact, we describe HITO, a Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order Problem, to adaptively select search operators while {\{}MOEAs{\}} are executed using one of the selection methods: Choice Function and Multi-Armed Bandit. The experimental results show that {\{}HITO{\}} can outperform the traditional {\{}MOEAs{\}} NSGA-II and MOEA/DD. {\{}HITO{\}} is also a generic algorithm, since the user does not need to select crossover and mutation operators, nor adjust their parameters. },

Important factors related to stubbing costs and constraints regarding to the software development context must be considered. To solve this problem, the most promising results were obtained with multi-objective algorithms, however few algorithms and contexts have been addressed by existing works. Considering such fact, this paper aims at introducing a generic approach based on multi-objective optimization to be applied in different development contexts and with distinct multi-objective algorithms. The approach is instantiated in the object and aspect-oriented contexts, and evaluated with real systems and three algorithms: NSGA-II, {\{}SPEA2{\}} and PAES. The algorithms are compared by using different number of objectives and four quality indicators. Results point out that the characteristics of the systems, the instantiation context and the number of objectives influence on the behavior of the algorithms. Although for more complex systems, {\{}PAES{\}} reaches better results, NSGA-II is more suitable to solve the referred problem in general cases, considering all systems and indicators. },

  abstract      = {The adoption of Agile Software Development in large companies is a recent phenomenon of great interest both for researchers and practitioners. Although intra-team interaction is well supported by established agile practices, the critical interaction between the agile team and other parts of the organization is still unexplored in literature. Such interactions slow down the development, hindering the achievement of business goals based on speed: short time to market, quick replication of products of a product-line, and reaction time for product evolution. We have employed a two-year long multiple-case case-study, collecting data through interviews and a survey in three large companies developing embedded software. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis, we have found strong evidence that interaction challenges between the development team and other groups in the organization hinder speed and are widespread in the organizations. This paper also identifies current practices in use at the studied companies and provides detailed guidelines for novel solutions in the investigated domain. Such practices are called boundary-spanning activities in information system research and coordination theory. We present a comparison between large embedded software companies employing agile and developing a line of products based on reused assets and agile companies developing pure software. We highlight specific contextual factors and areas where novel spanning activities are needed for mitigating the interaction challenges hindering speed.

Method: We present a process for detecting static anomalies based on mutation, equivalence checking, and quality measurement. Results: Our proposal and the originating technique are applicable to different kinds of software artifacts. We present anomalies and conduct several experiments in different contexts, at specification, design, and implementation level.

A major challenge for large SPLs is to efficiently explore a huge space of various products and satisfy a large number of predefined constraints simultaneously. To improve the optimality and convergence speed, we propose a parallel portfolio approach, called IBEAPORT, which designs three algorithm variants by incorporating constraint solving into the indicator-based evolutionary algorithm in different ways and performs these variants by utilizing parallelization techniques. Our approach utilizes the exploration capabilities of different algorithms and improves optimality as far as possible within a limited time budget. We evaluate our approach on five large-scale real-world SPLs. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art for all five SPLs on a quality indicator and a diversity indicator. Moreover, IBEAPORT quickly converges to a relatively stable hypervolume value even for the largest SPL with 6888 features. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The framework is based on a software product line architecture. It dynamically selects personalization methods during runtime that meet the current privacy constraints. Since dynamic architectural reconfiguration is typically resource-intensive, we conducted a performance evaluation with four implementations of our system that vary two factors. The results demonstrate that at least one implementation of our approach is technically feasible with comparatively modest additional resources, even for websites with the highest traffic today. To gauge user reactions to privacy controls that our framework enables, we also conducted a controlled experiment that allowed one group of users to specify privacy preferences and view the resulting effects on employed personalization methods. We found that users in this treatment group utilized this feature, deemed it useful, and had fewer privacy concerns as measured by higher disclosure of their personal data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The inherent characteristics of both strategies has led the research community to combine them, in what is commonly referred to as Service-Oriented Product Lines (SOPL) strategies. Despite the perceived potential of such a combination, there are many challenges to confront in order to provide a practical generalizable solution. In particular, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the actual support of variability implementation mechanisms, typical in SPL engineering, and their suitability for SOPL. In line with such a challenge, this paper presents a preliminary assessment aimed to identify variability implementation mechanisms which may improve measures of complexity, instability and modularity, quality attributes particularly important for modular and reusable software systems, as is the case of SOPL. Based on the results of these evaluations, an initial decision model is developed to provide software engineers with an adequate support for the selection of variability mechanisms. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

In this paper, we present a framework of terminology and concepts regarding product derivation that serves as basis for further discussion. We exemplify this framework with two industrial case studies, i.e. Thales Nederland B.V. and Robert Bosch GmbH. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

The use of these web services in the development process of WSbWAs can help overcome many problems of software use, deployment and evolution. Although the cost-effective software engineering of WSbWAs is potentially a very rewarding area, not much work has been done to accomplish short time to market conditions by viewing and dealing with WSbWAs as software products that can be derived from a common infrastructure and assets with a captured specific abstraction in the domain. Both Product Line Engineering (PLE) and Agile Methods (AMs), albeit with different philosophies, are software engineering approaches that can significantly shorten the time to market and increase the quality of products. Using the PLE approach we built, at the domain engineering level, a WSbWA-specific lightweight product-line architecture and combined it, at the application engineering level, with an Agile Method that uses a domain-specific visual language with direct manipulation and extraction capabilities of web services to perform customization and calibration of a product or WSBWA for a specific customer. To assess the effectiveness of our approach we designed and implemented a tool that we used to investigate the return on investment of the activities related to PLE and AMs. Details of our proposed approach, the related tool developed, and the experimental study performed are presented in this article together with a discussion of planned directions of future work.},

The current industrial practice is to develop and maintain these variants separately. Any potential change has to be applied across variants manually, which is neither efficient nor scalable. We consider the problem of supporting multiple platforms as a âsoftware product-line engineering' problem. The paper proposes a novel application of product-line model-driven engineering to mobile application development and addresses the key challenges of feature-based native mobile application variants for multiple platforms. Specifically, we deal with three types of variations in mobile applications: variation due to operation systems and their versions, software and hardware capabilities of mobile devices, and functionalities offered by the mobile application. We develop a tool MOPPET that automates the proposed approach. Finally, the results of applying the approach on two industrial case studies show that the proposed approach is applicable to industrial mobile applications and have potential to significantly reduce the development effort and time.},

Software quality has been an important topic since the beginning of the software development and production. Many researches have been conducted to discuss how the quality of software is a critical factor to its success [1â5]. Because software became an important part of almost every task in our daily life, having high quality software that meets the users' expectations is important [6]. Software integration is a stage in every software development lifecycle, it is defined as the process to assemble the software components and produce a single product. It has been shown that software integration and integration testing can make more than 40{\%} of the overall project cost, so it is important that they are done efficiently and easily to be able to manage the involved risks [7]. A software engineering practice called continuous integration (CI) was introduced by Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries to mitigate the risks of software integration, enhance its process and improve its quality [8]. In this research, the principles of CI are identified and applied to a case study in order to analyze their impact on the software development process quality factors.},

However, principles of unit verification are weakly explored, mostly due to the lack of data, since unit verification data are rarely systematically collected and only a few studies have been published with such data from industry. Therefore, we explore the theory of fault distributions, originating in the quantitative analysis by Fenton and Ohlsson, in the weakly explored context of unit verification in large-scale software development. We conduct a quantitative case study on a sequence of four development projects on consecutive releases of the same complex software product line system for telecommunication exchanges. We replicate the operationalization from earlier studies, analyzed hypotheses related to the Pareto principle of fault distribution, persistence of faults, effects of module size, and quality in terms of fault densities, however, now from the perspective of unit verification. The patterns in unit verification results resemble those of later verification phases, e.g., regarding the Pareto principle, and may thus be used for prediction and planning purposes. Using unit verification results as predictors may improve the quality and efficiency of software verification. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Abstract Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP) and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) are programming techniques based on composition mechanisms, called refinements and aspects, respectively. These techniques are assumed to be good variability mechanisms for implementing Software Product Lines (SPLs). Aspectual Feature Modules (AFM) is an approach that combines advantages of feature modules and aspects to increase concern modularity. Some guidelines on how to integrate these techniques have been established in some studies, but these studies do not focus the analysis on how effectively {\{}AFM{\}} can preserve the modularity and stability facilitating {\{}SPL{\}} evolution. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the simultaneous use of aspects and features through the {\{}AFM{\}} approach facilitates the evolution of SPLs. The quantitative data were collected from two {\{}SPLs{\}} developed using four different variability mechanisms: (1) feature modules, aspects and aspects refinements of AFM, (2) aspects of aspect-oriented programming (AOP), (3) feature modules of feature-oriented programming (FOP), and (4) conditional compilation (CC) with object-oriented programming. Metrics for change propagation and modularity were calculated and the results support the benefits of the {\{}AFM{\}} option in a context where the product line has been evolved with addition or modification of crosscutting concerns. However a drawback of this approach is that refactoring components' design requires a higher degree of modifications to the {\{}SPL{\}} structure. },

Most of the current frameworks used in the industry for building enterprise applications adopt this approach. However, there is a lack of proven techniques for building such kind of framework, allowing for a better organization of its internal structure. In this paper we propose a pattern language and a reference architecture for better organizing the internal structure of metadata-based frameworks, which were defined as a result of a pattern mining process applied to a set of existing open source frameworks. To evaluate the resulting structure generated by the reference architecture application, a case study examined three frameworks developed according to the proposed reference architecture, each one referring to a distinct application domain. The assessment was conducted by using a metrics suite, metrics thresholds derived from a large set of open source metadata-based frameworks, a process for automatic detection of design disharmonies and manual source code analysis. As a result of this study, framework developers can understand and use the proposed reference architecture to develop new frameworks and refactor existing ones. The assessment revealed that the organization provided by the reference architecture is suitable for metadata-based frameworks, helping in the division of responsibility and functionality among their classes. },

  abstract = {Context: Most specialized users (scientists) that use bioinformatics applications do not have suitable training on software development. Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area. Objectives: This paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains. Method: In the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated. Results: Through the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification. Conclusions: This paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation. This evaluation presents case studies in bioinformatics, which were conducted in two renowned research institutions in Brazil. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

Traceability has been successfully applied in many software engineering communities and has recently been adopted to document the transition among requirements, architecture and implementation. We present an approach to customize traceability to the situation at hand. Instead of automating tracing, or representing all possible traces, we scope the traces to be maintained to the activities stakeholders must carry out. We define core traceability paths, consisting of essential traceability links required to support the activities. We illustrate the approach through two examples: product derivation in software product lines, and release planning in software process management. By using a running software product line example, we explain why the core traceability paths identified are needed when navigating from feature to structural models and from family to product level and backward between models used in software product derivation. A feasibility study in release planning carried out in an industrial setting further illustrates the use of core traceability paths during production and measures the increase in performance of the development processes supported by our approach. These examples show that our approach can be successfully used to support both product and process traceability in a pragmatic yet efficient way. },

  abstract = {Abstract With the advent of Cloud Computing, new opportunities for Business Process Outsourcing services have emerged. Business Process as a Service (BPaaS), a new cloud service model, has recently gained a great importance for outsourcing cloud-based business processes constructed for multi-tenancy. In such a multi-tenant environment, using configurable business process models enables the sharing of a reference process among different tenants that can be customized according to specific needs. With a large choice of configurable process modeling languages, different providers may deliver configurable processes with common functionalities but different representations which makes the process discovery and configuration a manual tedious task. This in turn creates cloud silos and vendors lock-in with non-reusable configurable {\{}BPaaS{\}} models. Therefore, with the aim of enabling the interoperability between multiple {\{}BPaaS{\}} providers, we propose in this paper a semantic framework for {\{}BPaaS{\}} configurable models. Taking advantage of Semantic Web technologies and data mining techniques, our framework allows for (1) an ontology-based high level abstract representation of {\{}BPaaS{\}} configurable models enriched with configuration guidelines and (2) an automated approach for extracting the configuration guidelines from existing process repositories. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we extend Signavio with our semantic framework and conduct experiments on a dataset from {\{}SAP{\}} reference model. },

  abstract = {Abstract Platform as a service (PaaS) is one of the Cloud computing services that provide a computing platform in the Cloud, allowing customers to develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. The primary disadvantage for an {\{}SME{\}} to enter the emerging PaaS market is the possibility of being locked into a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport project focuses on facilitating {\{}SMEs{\}} to deploy business applications on the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering and to seamlessly migrate these applications on demand, via a thin, non-intrusive Cloud-broker, in the form of a Cloud PaaS Marketplace. PaaSport enables PaaS provider {\{}SMEs{\}} to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings, by annotating them using a unified PaaS semantic model that has been defined as an {\{}OWL{\}} ontology. In this paper we focus on the recommendation algorithm that has been developed on top of the ontology, for providing the application developer with recommendations about the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering. The algorithm consists of: a) a matchmaking part, where the functional parameters of the application are taken into account to rule out inconsistent offerings, and b) a ranking part, where the non-functional parameters of the application are considered to score and rank offerings. Î¤he algorithm is extensively evaluated showing linear scalability to the number of offerings and application requirements. Furthermore, it is extensible upon future semantic model extensions, because it is agnostic to domain specific concepts and parameters, using {\{}SPARQL{\}} template queries. },

  abstract = {Whilst cloud computing has burst into the current scene as a technology that allows companies to access high computing rates at limited costs, cloud vendors have rushed to provide tools that allow developers to build software for their cloud platforms. The software developed with these tools is often tightly coupled to their services and restrictions. Consequently vendor lock in becomes a common problem which multiple cloud users have to tackle in order to exploit the full potential of cloud computing. A scenario where component-based applications are developed for being deployed across several clouds, and each component can independently be deployed in one cloud or another, remains fictitious due to the complexity and the cost of their development. This paper presents a cloud development framework for developing cloud agnostic applications that may be deployed indifferently across multiple cloud platforms. Information about cloud deployment and cloud integration is separated from the source code and managed by the framework. Interoperability between interdependent components deployed in different clouds is achieved by automatically generating services and service clients. This allows software developers to segment their applications into different modules that can easily be deployed and redistributed across heterogeneous cloud platforms. },

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we deal with the development of dynamically reconfigurable embedded systems in terms of the production of execution schedules of system tasks (feasible configuration) under hard real-time constraints. Indeed, several real-time embedded systems must be dynamically reconfigured to account for hardware/software faults and/or maintain acceptable performances. Depending on the run-time environment, some reconfigurations might be unfeasible, i.e., they violate some real-time constraints of the system. More specifically, we propose an approach that starts from a set of reconfigurations to construct a Software Product Line (SPL) that can be reused in a predictive and organized way to derive real-time embedded systems. To make sure that the {\{}SPL{\}} offers various feasible reconfigurations, we define an intelligent agent (IA) that automatically checks the system's feasibility after a reconfiguration scenario is applied on a multiprocessor embedded system. This agent dynamically determines precious technical solutions to define a new product whenever a reconfiguration is unfeasible. The set of products thus defined by the agent can then be unified into an SPL. The originality of our approach is its capacity to extract, from the unfeasible configurations of an embedded system, an {\{}SPL{\}} design enriched with real-time constraints and modeled with a {\{}UML{\}} Marte profile. The {\{}SPL{\}} design can assist in the comprehension, reconfiguration as well as evolution of the {\{}SPL{\}} in order to satisfy real-time requirements and to obtain a feasible system under normal and overload conditions. },

The proposed formal two-layered framework, called CS-AHP, provides the means for representing and reasoning over conditional preferences. The framework can also effectively order decision outcomes based on conditional preferences in a way that is consistent with well-formed preferences. Finally, the framework provides an estimation of the potential number of violations and inconsistencies within the preferences. We provide and report extensive performance analysis for the proposed framework from three different perspectives, namely time-complexity, simulated decision making scenarios, and handling cyclic and partially defined preferences. },

Applying the agile approaches and practices in the distributed environment will lead to gain a lot of benefits such as reduced costs, higher efficiency and better customization, on the other hand it will face many challenges for example working in different time zones, requirements changes, personal selection and knowledge management. In order to gain these benefits, it should address the challenges that will face the agile approaches in a distributed environment. One of the main challenges is managing the requirements changes during the process of distributed agile software development. Only few researches published in the literature, addressed the problem of requirements changes during the development process in distributed agile development. Most of the published researches in this context are based on industrial experiences which increases the need for combining the industry with academia within this area. In this paper an approach to manage requirements changes in distributed agile development is introduced. This suggested approach works to fill the gap between the industry and research in distributed agile development by combining the industrial practice and academic technique. This approach is based on a proposed feature model called a features tree. The approach is associated with a supporting software tool that helps to manage the requirement changes in distributed agile development. The supporting tool is tested and evaluated in real environments by software development professionals using an exhaustive set of criteria, and the results are promising.},

However, the gradual increase of the test suite size demands high portion of testing budget and time. Test Suite Reduction (TSR) is considered a potential approach to deal with the test suite size problem. Moreover, a complete automation support is highly recommended for software testing to adequately meet the challenges of a resource constrained testing environment. Several TSR frameworks and tools have been proposed to efficiently address the test-suite size problem. The main objective of the paper is to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art TSR frameworks to highlights their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the paper focuses on devising a detailed thematic taxonomy to classify existing literature that helps in understanding the underlying issues and proof of concept. Moreover, the paper investigates critical aspects and related features of TSR frameworks and tools based on a set of defined parameters. We also rigorously elaborated various testing domains and approaches followed by the extant TSR frameworks. The results reveal that majority of TSR frameworks focused on randomized unit testing, and a considerable number of frameworks lacks in supporting multi-objective optimization problems. Moreover, there is no generalized framework, effective for testing applications developed in any programming domain. Conversely, Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based TSR frameworks provide an optimal solution for multi-objective optimization problems and improve execution time by running multiple ILP in parallel. The study concludes with new insights and provides an unbiased view of the state-of-the-art TSR frameworks. Finally, we present potential research issues for further investigation to anticipate efficient TSR frameworks.},

  abstract = {Context
Handling multiple quality attributes (QAs) in the domain of self-adaptive systems is an understudied research area. One well-known approach to engineer adaptive software systems and fulfill QAs of the system is architecture-based self-adaptation. In order to develop models that capture the required knowledge of the QAs of interest, and to investigate how these models can be employed at runtime to handle multiple quality attributes, we need to first examine current architecture-based self-adaptive methods.
Objective
In this paper we review the state-of-the-art of architecture-based methods for handling multiple QAs in self-adaptive systems. We also provide a descriptive analysis of the collected data from the literature.
Method
We conducted a systematic literature review by performing an automatic search on 28 selected venues and books in the domain of self-adaptive systems. As a result, we selected 54 primary studies which we used for data extraction and analysis.
Results
Performance and cost are the most frequently addressed set of QAs. Current self-adaptive systems dealing with multiple QAs mostly belong to the domain of robotics and web-based systems paradigm. The most widely used mechanisms/models to measure and quantify QAs sets are QA data variables. After QA data variables, utility functions and Markov chain models are the most common models which are also used for decision making process and selection of the best solution in presence of many alternatives. The most widely used tools to deal with multiple QAs are PRISM and IBM's autonomic computing toolkit. KLAPER is the only language that has been specifically developed to deal with quality properties analysis.
Conclusions
Our results help researchers to understand the current state of research regarding architecture-based methods for handling multiple QAs in self-adaptive systems, and to identity areas for improvement in the future. To summarize, further research is required to improve existing methods performing tradeoff analysis and preemption, and in particular, new methods may be proposed to make use of models to handle multiple QAs and to enhance and facilitate the tradeoffs analysis and decision making mechanism at runtime.},

Typical SPLE efforts involve a large number of features that are combined to form also large numbers of products, implemented using multiple and different types of software artifacts.

  abstract  = {Context: In software development, Testing is an important mechanism both to identify defects and assure that completed products work as specified. This is a common practice in single-system development, and continues to hold in Software Product Lines (SPL). Even though extensive research has been done in the SPL Testing field, it is necessary to assess the current state of research and practice, in order to provide practitioners with evidence that enable fostering its further development. Objective: This paper focuses on Testing in SPL and has the following goals: investigate state-of-the-art testing practices, synthesize available evidence, and identify gaps between required techniques and existing approaches, available in the literature. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted with a set of nine research questions, in which 120 studies, dated from 1993 to 2009, were evaluated. Results: Although several aspects regarding testing have been covered by single-system development approaches, many cannot be directly applied in the SPL context due to specific issues. In addition, particular aspects regarding SPL are not covered by the existing SPL approaches, and when the aspects are covered, the literature just gives brief overviews. This scenario indicates that additional investigation, empirical and practical, should be performed. Conclusion: The results can help to understand the needs in SPL Testing, by identifying points that still require additional investigation, since important aspects regarding particular points of software product lines have not been addressed yet. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) are used in industry to develop families of similar software systems. Legacy systems, either highly configurable or with a story of versions and local variations, are potential candidates for reconfiguration as SPLs using reengineering techniques. Existing SPLs can also be restructured using specific refactorings to improve their internal quality. Although many contributions (including industrial experiences) can be found in the literature, we lack a global vision covering the whole life cycle of an evolving product line. This study aims to survey existing research on the reengineering of legacy systems into SPLs and the refactoring of existing SPLs in order to identify proven approaches and pending challenges for future research in both subfields. We launched a systematic mapping study to find as much literature as possible, covering the diverse terms involved in the search string (restructuring, refactoring, reengineering, etc. always connected with SPLs) and filtering the papers using relevance criteria. The 74 papers selected were classified with respect to several dimensions: main focus, research and contribution type, academic or industrial validation if included, etc. We classified the research approaches and analyzed their feasibility for use in industry. The results of the study indicate that the initial works focused on the adaptation of generic reengineering processes to SPL extraction. Starting from that foundation, several trends have been detected in recent research: the integrated or guided reengineering of (typically object-oriented) legacy code and requirements; specific aspect-oriented or feature-oriented refactoring into SPLs, and more recently, refactoring for the evolution of existing product lines. A majority of papers include academic or industrial case studies, though only a few are based on quantitative data. The degree of maturity of both subfields is different: Industry examples for the reengineering of the legacy system subfield are abundant, although more evaluation research is needed to provide better evidence for adoption in industry. Product line evolution through refactoring is an emerging topic with some pending challenges. Although it has recently received some attention, the theoretical foundation is rather limited in this subfield and should be addressed in the near future. To sum up, the main contributions of this work are the classification of research approaches as well as the analysis of remaining challenges, open issues, and research opportunities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Context Complex software-intensive systems comprise many subsystems that are often based on heterogeneous technological platforms and managed by different organizational units. Multi product lines (MPLs) are an emerging area of research addressing variability management for such large-scale or ultra-large-scale systems. Despite the increasing number of publications addressing {\{}MPLs{\}} the research area is still quite fragmented. Objective The aims of this paper are thus to identify, describe, and classify existing approaches supporting {\{}MPLs{\}} and to increase the understanding of the underlying research issues. Furthermore, the paper aims at defining success-critical capabilities of infrastructures supporting MPLs. Method Using a systematic literature review we identify and analyze existing approaches and research issues regarding MPLs. Approaches described in the literature support capabilities needed to define and operate MPLs. We derive capabilities supporting {\{}MPLs{\}} from the results of the systematic literature review. We validate and refine these capabilities based on a survey among experts from academia and industry. Results The paper discusses key research issues in {\{}MPLs{\}} and presents basic and advanced capabilities supporting MPLs. We also show examples from research approaches that demonstrate how these capabilities can be realized. Conclusions We conclude that approaches supporting {\{}MPLs{\}} need to consider both technical aspects like structuring large models and defining dependencies between product lines as well as organizational aspects such as distributed modeling and product derivation by multiple stakeholders. The identified capabilities can help to build, enhance, and evaluate {\{}MPL{\}} approaches. },

  abstract = {Domain analysis is crucial and central to software product line engineering (SPLE) as it is one of the main instruments to decide what to include in a product and how it should fit in to the overall software product line. For this reason many domain analysis solutions have been proposed both by researchers and industry practitioners. Domain analysis comprises various modeling and scoping activities. This paper presents a systematic review of all the domain analysis solutions presented until 2007. The goal of the review is to analyze the level of industrial application and/or empirical validation of the proposed solutions with the purpose of mapping maturity in terms of industrial application, as well as to what extent proposed solutions might have been evaluated in terms of usability and usefulness. The finding of this review indicates that, although many new domain analysis solutions for software product lines have been proposed over the years, the absence of qualitative and quantitative results from empirical application and/or validation makes it hard to evaluate the potential of proposed solutions with respect to their usability and/or usefulness for industry adoption. The detailed results of the systematic review can be used by individual researchers to see large gaps in research that give opportunities for future work, and from a general research perspective lessons can be learned from the absence of validation as well as from good examples presented. From an industry practitioner view, the results can be used to gauge as to what extent solutions have been applied and/or validated and in what manner, both valuable as input prior to industry adoption of a domain analysis solution. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that software measures provide an appropriate mechanism for understanding, monitoring, controlling, and predicting the quality of software development projects. In software product lines (SPL), quality is even more important than in a single software product since, owing to systematic reuse, a fault or an inadequate design decision could be propagated to several products in the family. Over the last few years, a great number of quality attributes and measures for assessing the quality of SPL have been reported in literature. However, no studies summarizing the current knowledge about them exist. This paper presents a systematic literature review with the objective of identifying and interpreting all the available studies from 1996 to 2010 that present quality attributes and/or measures for SPL. These attributes and measures have been classified using a set of criteria that includes the life cycle phase in which the measures are applied; the corresponding quality characteristics; their support for specific SPL characteristics (e. g., variability, compositionality); the procedure used to validate the measures, etc. We found 165 measures related to 97 different quality attributes. The results of the review indicated that 92{\%} of the measures evaluate attributes that are related to maintainability. In addition, 67{\%} of the measures are used during the design phase of Domain Engineering, and 56{\%} are applied to evaluate the product line architecture. However, only 25{\%} of them have been empirically validated. In conclusion, the results provide a global vision of the state of the research within this area in order to help researchers in detecting weaknesses, directing research efforts, and identifying new research lines. In particular, there is a need for new measures with which to evaluate both the quality of the artifacts produced during the entire SPL life cycle and other quality characteristics. There is also a need for more validation (both theoretical and empirical) of existing measures. In addition, our results may be useful as a reference guide for practitioners to assist them in the selection or the adaptation of existing measures for evaluating their software product lines. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {AbstractContext Search Based Software Testing refers to the use of meta-heuristics for the optimization of a task in the context of software testing. Meta-heuristics can solve complex problems in which an optimum solution must be found among a large amount of possibilities. The use of meta-heuristics in testing activities is promising because of the high number of inputs that should be tested. Previous studies on search based software testing have focused on the application of meta-heuristics for the optimization of structural and functional criteria. Recently, some researchers have proposed the use of {\{}SBST{\}} for mutation testing and explored solutions for the cost of application of this testing criterion. Objective The objective is to identify how {\{}SBST{\}} has been explored in the context of mutation testing, how fitness functions are defined and the challenges and research opportunities in the application of meta-heuristic search techniques. Method A systematic review involving 263 papers published between 1996 and 2014 examined the studies on the use of meta-heuristic search techniques for the optimization of mutation testing. Results The results show meta-heuristic search techniques have been applied for the optimization of test data generation, mutant generation and selection of effective mutation operators. Five meta-heuristic techniques, namely Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony, Bacteriological Algorithm, Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing have been used in search based mutation testing. The review addressed different fitness functions used to guide the search. Conclusion Search based mutation testing is a field of interest, however, some issues remain unexplored. For instance, the use of meta-heuristics for the selection of effective mutation operators was identified in only one study. The results have pointed a range of possibilities for new studies to be developed, i.e., identification of equivalent mutants, experimental studies and application to different domains, such as concurrent programs. },

Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most relevant approaches addressing the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases. While some phases of the development cycle have been extensively explored, there is still room for research in other phases, toward a more agile and integrated cycle, from requirements to testing and feedback. },

The objective of this systematic literature review is to summarize the current state of the art of functional testing of semantic web services by providing answers to a set of research questions. The review follows a predefined procedure that involves automatically searching 5 well-known digital libraries. After applying the selection criteria to the results, a total of 34 studies were identified as relevant. Required information was extracted from the studies and summarized. Our systematic literature review identified some approaches available for deriving test cases from the specifications of semantic web services. However, many of the approaches are either not validated or the validation done lacks credibility. We believe that a substantial amount of work remains to be done to improve the current state of research in the area of testing semantic web services. },

  abstract = {In the scientific community, feature models are the de-facto standard for representing variability in software product line engineering. This is different from industrial settings where they appear to be used much less frequently. We and other authors found that in a number of cases, they lack concision, naturalness and expressiveness. This is confirmed by industrial experience. When modelling variability, an efficient tool for making models intuitive and concise are feature attributes. Yet, the semantics of feature models with attributes is not well understood and most existing notations do not support them at all. Furthermore, the graphical nature of feature models' syntax also appears to be a barrier to industrial adoption, both psychological and rational. Existing tool support for graphical feature models is lacking or inadequate, and inferior in many regards to tool support for text-based formats. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed TVL, a text-based feature modelling language. In terms of expressiveness, {\{}TVL{\}} subsumes most existing dialects. The main goal of designing {\{}TVL{\}} was to provide engineers with a human-readable language with a rich syntax to make modelling easy and models natural, but also with a formal semantics to avoid ambiguity and allow powerful automation. },

This new situation demands new features from transformation tools, and a solid semantic foundation to understand and classify these features. We address the problem by presenting a taxonomy of model synchronization types, organized into a 3D-space. Each point in the space refers to a specific synchronization semantics with an underlying algebraic model and the respective requirements for the change propagation operations and their properties. The taxonomy aims to help with identifying and communicating a proper specification for the synchronization problem at hand and for the available solutions offered by tools.},

The language has several advantages. Firstly, it does not require people, who perform customization, to have knowledge of Web service technologies. Thus, the language enables business users-friendly service customization. Secondly, the language captures not only what can be customized, but also how and where customization operations should happen in a service-oriented way. This self-described property removes the need for a separate procedure for governing service customization. Consequently, this property eases the adoption of the language. We elaborate the design of the language using a case study and describe its usages from both consumers and providers' viewpoints. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Such a process-oriented view of methodologies, based on the metaphor that human organizations are âmachinesâ that âexecuteâ processes, often results in methodologies that are too rigid and hard to follow, and most often than not end up being ignored or bypassed. Our proposal here is that, since the ultimate aim of software development is to provide a software product, software development methodologies should be described in terms of the intermediate products that are necessary to reach such a final product, plus the needed micro-processes that, as necessary evils, will be required to produce the appropriate work products from other, previously created ones. Using this product-oriented approach, software development methodologies can be specified that are, at least, as flexible as lightweight, agile approaches and, at the same time, as powerful and scalable as plan-oriented ones. },

  abstract = {Abstract A recently proposed pipelined multithreading (PMT) technique exhibits wide applicability in parallelizing general sequential programs on multi-core processors. However, significant inter-core communication overhead limits {\{}PMT{\}} performance and prevents its commercial utilization. A simple and effective clustered pipelined multithreading (CPMT) approach is presented to accelerate sequential programs on commodity multi-core processors. This {\{}CPMT{\}} technique adopts a clustered communication mechanism that can yield very low average communication overhead by eliminating false sharing as well as reducing communication operation and transit delays in the software-only approach. A single-producer/single-consumer concurrent lock-free clusteredQueue algorithm based on a two-level queue structure is also proposed. The accuracy of {\{}CPMT{\}} is theoretically demonstrated. The performances of the algorithm and {\{}CPMT{\}} are evaluated on a commodity {\{}AMD{\}} Phenom four-core processor. The number of enqueue and dequeue times of the algorithm are 20.8 and 23 cycles given an appropriate parameter, respectively. The speedup of {\{}CPMT{\}} ranges from 13.1{\%} to 119.8{\%} for typical loops extracted from the {\{}SPEC{\}} {\{}CPU{\}} 2000 benchmark suite. },

  abstract = {In feature-oriented programming (FOP) a programmer decomposes a program in terms of features. Ideally, features are implemented modularly so that they can be developed in isolation. Access control mechanisms in the form of access or visibility modifiers are an important ingredient to attain feature modularity as they allow programmers to hide and expose internal details of a module's implementation. But developers of contemporary feature-oriented languages have not considered access control mechanisms so far. The absence of a well-defined access control model for {\{}FOP{\}} breaks encapsulation of feature code and leads to unexpected program behaviors and inadvertent type errors. We raise awareness of this problem, propose three feature-oriented access modifiers, and present a corresponding access modifier model. We offer an implementation of the model on the basis of a fully-fledged feature-oriented compiler. Finally, by analyzing ten feature-oriented programs, we explore the potential of feature-oriented modifiers in FOP. },

For instance, a Web service operation may have greatly increased its execution time or may have become unavailable. The contribution of this article is to provide a tool-supported framework to guide autonomic adjustments of context-aware service compositions using models at runtime. During execution, when problematic events arise in the context, models are used by an autonomic architecture to guide changes of the service composition. Under the closed-world assumption, the possible context events are fully known at design time. Nevertheless, it is difficult to foresee all the possible situations arising in uncertain contexts where service compositions run. Therefore, the proposed framework also covers the dynamic evolution of service compositions to deal with unexpected events in the open world. An evaluation demonstrates that our framework is efficient during dynamic adjustments.},

The aforementioned factors introduce uncertainty in all phases of a Grid Scheduling Process (GSP). This work describes a synergistic multidisciplinary approach which aims at addressing this uncertainty. It proposes a network of resource representatives (RRs), which maintain the more or less static characteristics of available workers they represent. Clustering techniques are used for the efficient searching in the network of {\{}RRs{\}} by client agents. After the discovery of possibly suitable resources, client agents and resource agents negotiate directly for the selection of the best available resource set. Finally, according to the characteristics of the selected resource set and its current state, we propose a component-based application configuration approach based on component variants, that adjusts the application for the forthcoming execution phase in the selected resource set. We evaluate our approach using simulation and we show that it outperforms centralized index approaches for large computational grids. },

Key characteristics of agile methods are lean and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. {\{}PLE{\}} leverages reuse through systematic approaches such as variability modeling or product derivation. Integrating agile approaches with product line engineering is an interesting proposition which â not surprisingly â entails several challenges: Product lines (PL) rely on complex plans and models to ensure their long-term evolution while agile methods emphasize simplicity and short-term value-creation for customers. When incorporating agility in product line engineering, it is thus essential to define carefully how agile principles can support particular {\{}PLE{\}} processes. For instance, the processes of defining and setting up a product line (domain engineering) and deriving products (application engineering) differ significantly in practices and focus with implications on the suitability of agile principles. This paper presents practical experiences of adopting agile principles in product line planning (a domain engineering activity). ThinkLets, i.e., collaborative practices from the area of collaboration engineering, are the building blocks of the presented approach as they codify agile principles such as stakeholder involvement, rapid feedback, or value-based prioritization. We discuss how our approach balances agility and the intrinsic needs of product line planning.

  abstract      = {Context Software Product Line Engineering implies the upfront design of a Product-Line Architecture (PLA) from which individual product applications can be engineered. The big upfront design associated with PLAs is in conflict with the current need of "being open to change". To make the development of product-lines more flexible and adaptable to changes, several companies are adopting Agile Product Line Engineering. However, to put Agile Product Line Engineering into practice it is still necessary to make mechanisms available to assist and guide the agile construction and evolution of PLAs. Objective This paper presents the validation of a process for "the agile construction and evolution of product-line architectures", called Agile Product-Line Architecting (APLA). The contribution of the APLA process is the integration of a set of models for describing, documenting, and tracing PLAs, as well as an algorithm for guiding the change decision-making process of PLAs. The APLA process is assessed to prove that assists Agile Product Line Engineering practitioners in the construction and evolution of PLAs. Method Validation is performed through a case study by using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Quantitative analysis was performed using statistics, whereas qualitative analysis was performed through interviews using constant comparison, triangulation, and supporting tools. This case study was conducted according to the guidelines of Runeson and H{\"{o}}st in a software factory where three projects in the domain of Smart Grids were involved. Results APLA is deployed through the Flexible-PLA modeling framework. This framework supported the successful development and evolution of the PLA of a family of power metering management applications for Smart Grids. Conclusions APLA is a well-supported solution for the agile construction and evolution of PLAs. This case study illustrates that the proposed solution for the agile construction of PLAs is viable in an industry project on Smart Grids. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Besides, {\{}CMMI{\}} (Capability Maturity Model Integration) models are well-established approaches focused on assessing the maturity of an organization that develops software. Web Engineering is the field of Software Engineering responsible for analyzing and studying the specific characteristics of the Web. The suitability of an Agile approach to help organizations reach a certain {\{}CMMI{\}} maturity level in Web environments will be very interesting, as they will be able to keep the ability to quickly react and adapt to changes as long as their development processes get mature. Objective This paper responds to whether it is feasible or not, for an organization developing Web systems, to achieve a certain maturity level of the CMMI-DEV model using Agile methods. Method The proposal is analyzed by means of a systematic literature review of the relevant approaches in the field, defining a characterization schema in order to compare them to introduce the current state-of-the-art. Results The results achieved after the systematic literature review are presented, analyzed and compared against the defined schema, extracting relevant conclusions for the different dimensions of the problem: compatibility, compliance, experience, maturity and Web.

  abstract = {Time synchronization is a critical component in any wireless sensor network (WSN). In terms of energy consumption, on-demand time synchronization is better than continuous synchronization. However, currently existing on-demand time synchronization protocols have a very low accuracy and very strong spatial accumulative effect. These features are not suitable for several types of {\{}WSN{\}} applications, such as applications with stringent temporal requirements, or applications that have a large spatial region of interest. In this paper, we propose an on-demand time synchronization protocol, named {\{}AOTSP{\}} (Accurate On-demand Time Synchronization Protocol), which differs from other protocols of the same category by having the following advantages, as shown in our theoretical analysis and simulation results: (1) weak spatial accumulative effect; (2) fairly low communication cost; (3) low computational complexity; (4) high accuracy; (5) high scalability. Such features make {\{}AOTSP{\}} a suitable time synchronization protocol for a broad range of {\{}WSN{\}} applications. },

  abstract = {Abstract There has been a great deal of research on software quality, but few studies have stressed the factors beyond the scope of software products that can influence the final product's quality. These factors can also determine project success. Objective In this paper, a comparative study is conducted of the determinants of software quality, based on a prior study that only explored U.S. CIOs' (Chief Information Officers) perceptions of factors that could affect the final quality of software products. The aim of this study is to explore the perceptions of different users involved in the software development cycle and generate results that can be generalized and employed as an aid in the management of software project resources. Method The study was conducted through an online survey to various users involved in the software development cycle in Brazil. The respondents analyzed the same 24 items proposed in the previous study, categorized into individual, technological, and organizational factors. Based on the 175 responses obtained, a factor analysis technique was applied, considering the statistical model of the main components in order to identify the factors determining the quality of software products. Results After the factor analysis, it was identified that all 24 analyzed items displayed factor loadings greater than 0.5. Nine factors (9 eigenvalues greater than 1.0) were extracted from this analysis, with the value of the total variance equal to 72{\%}. Conclusion Based upon the comparison between the studies, it was concluded that the most relevant factor identified in both surveys presented an individual character. This factor related items such as competence, training, knowledge, and level of user involvement as well as resistance to change. It was also identified through factor analysis that technological aspects had the highest ratings due to the strong relationship of the items comprising these factors compared to organizational aspects. },

When the security policies dynamically change, the associated security functionalities currently deployed within the applications must be adapted at runtime in order to enforce the new security policies. INTER-TRUST is a framework for the specification, negotiation, deployment and dynamic adaptation of interoperable security policies, in the context of pervasive systems where devices are constantly exchanging critical information through the network. The dynamic adaptation of the security policies at runtime is addressed using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) that allows enforcing security requirements by dynamically weaving security aspects into the applications. However, a mechanism to guarantee the correct adaptation of the functionality that enforces the changing security policies is needed. In this paper, we present an approach based on the combination of monitoring and detection techniques in order to maintain the correlation between the security policies and the associated functionality deployed using AOP, allowing the INTER-TRUST framework to automatically react when needed. },

Requirements engineering for software product families differs significantly from requirements engineering for single software products. The requirements for a product line are written for the group of systems as a whole, with requirements for individual systems specified by a delta or an increment to the generic set. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and explicitly denote the regions of commonality and points of variation at the requirements level. In this paper, we suggest a method of producing requirements that will be a core asset in the product line. We describe a process for developing domain requirements where commonality and variability in a domain are explicitly considered. A CASE environment, named DREAM, for managing commonality and valiability analysis of domain requirements is also described. We also describe a case study for an e-Travel System domain where we found that our approach to developing domain requirements based on commonality and variability analysis helped to produce domain requirements as a core asset for product lines. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

Not only is a requirement dependencies model presented, but a directed graph-based approach is also developed to analyze domain requirement dependencies for effective release of member products in a product line.

  abstract = {AbstractContext Context-aware service-based applications development has been considered among the most studied research fields in the last decade. The objective was to accompany the rapid technology evolution of mobile computing devices by providing customized services able to interact with different contextual situations of a pervasive environment. For this purpose, many research works have advocated Model-Driven Development (MDD) for building context-aware service-based applications. However, the proposed approaches have presented specific methodologies without using development standards, which may be followed by developers. In addition, most of them have ignored the dynamic adaptation aspect at runtime that should characterize such kind of applications and no adaptation strategy was considered in their proposals. Objective The current paper aims to propose a generic model-driven approach for context-aware service-based applications engineering with a software development methodology including a reconfiguration loop to achieve the dynamic adaptation of these applications. Method This approach focuses on the combination of {\{}MDD{\}} and Aspect Oriented Modelling (AOM) to take advantage of their benefits. {\{}AOM{\}} encapsulates different context-awareness logics separately in aspect models called ContextAspect that can be easily woven into the service's business logic according to the changing context over time. The proposed development methodology includes four phases (modelling, composition, transformation and adaptation) which act in conformance with the {\{}MDA{\}} technology. Results The main results gained by using the present approach are the possibility to combine the {\{}MDA{\}} technology with the aspect-oriented paradigm in a generic development methodology for context-aware service-based applications, and the handling of their dynamic adaptation at execution time according to the changes in the context. Conclusion The development of context-aware applications is a complex, cumbersome, and time-consuming task. However, the experience reached by implementing the proposed methodology leads us to believe that the involvement of {\{}MDD{\}} and {\{}AOM{\}} is significantly beneficial to overcome some recognised shortcomings of several existing approaches and to make this task simpler, easier and faster. },

  abstract = {Abstract Successful software evolves from a single system by adding and changing functionality to keep up with users' demands and to cater to their similar and different requirements. Nowadays it is a common practice to offer a system in many variants such as community, professional, or academic editions. Each variant provides different functionality described in terms of features. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is an effective software development paradigm for this scenario. At the core of {\{}SPLE{\}} is variability modelling whose goal is to represent the combinations of features that distinguish the system variants using feature models, the de facto standard for such task. As {\{}SPLE{\}} practices are becoming more pervasive, reverse engineering feature models from the feature descriptions of each individual variant has become an active research subject. In this paper we evaluated, for this reverse engineering task, three standard search based techniques (evolutionary algorithms, hill climbing, and random search) with two objective functions on 74 SPLs. We compared their performance using precision and recall, and found a clear trade-off between these two metrics which we further reified into a third objective function based on F$\beta$, an information retrieval measure, that showed a clear performance improvement. We believe that this work sheds light on the great potential of search-based techniques for {\{}SPLE{\}} tasks. },

One promising approach to consider this variability in MAS is the use of the concept of Multiagent System-Product Line (MAS-PL). The idea is to implement a family of MAS that belong to the same domain, instead of a single MAS. However, there is still a lack of methodological support to develop MAS-PL. This paper tackles this problem with a rigorous respect of software product line principals. We propose an automated approach, the Meduse for MAS-PL, to generate families of MAS-PL methods that offer software product line best practices integrated with existing MAS development approaches to support MAS-PL development. To illustrate, we present a case study involving a family of MAS-PL methods that extends Gaia and Tropos. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Fault tree generation technology is a key issue for safety analysis of large complex systems. Traditional safety analysis methods usually describe the origin, propagation, or concrete behavior of the fault and do not portray the constraints between faults. However, these constraints are the system's characteristics, and a lack of expression of these constraints will make the fault model defective, thereby resulting in a fault tree that will reduce the accuracy of the safety analysis. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of safety analysis, this paper proposes a fault tree generation method that is based on fault configuration and introduces the variability management of software product lines to model system faults and perform the formal analysis. First, the fault feature diagram is defined to describe the constraint relationships between system faults, and the fault-labeled transition system is defined based on the Kripke structure to describe the system behavior. Then, based on the model semantics, the procedure for generating fault trees by model checking is established. Finally, using temporal logic to describe the system safety attributes, we adopt the model checking tool SNIP to verify the safety attributes and generate the fault tree automatically. The fault modeling method that is proposed in this paper includes the inherent constraints between faults, which makes the system fault model more realistic and accurate. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Abstract Some quality attributes can be modelled using software components, and are normally known as Functional Quality Attributes (FQAs). Applications may require different FQAs, and each {\{}FQA{\}} (e.g., security) can be composed of many concerns (e.g., access control or authentication). They normally have dependencies between them and crosscut the system architecture. The goal of the work presented here is to provide the means for software architects to focus only on application functionality, without having to worry about FQAs. The idea is to model {\{}FQAs{\}} separately from application functionality following a Software Product Line (SPL) approach. By combining {\{}SPL{\}} and aspect-oriented mechanisms, we will define a generic process to model and automatically inject {\{}FQAs{\}} into the application without breaking the base architecture. We will provide and compare two implementations of our generic approach using different variability and architecture description languages: (i) feature models and an aspect-oriented architecture description language; and (ii) the Common Variability Language (CVL) and a MOF-compliant language (e.g., UML). We also discuss the benefits and limitations of our approach. Modelling {\{}FQAs{\}} separately from the base application has many advantages (e.g., reusability, less coupled components, high cohesive architectures). },

  abstract = {Nowadays open-source software communities are thriving. Successful open-source projects are competitive and the amount of source code that is freely available offers great reuse opportunities to software developers. Thus, it is expected that several requirements can be implemented based on open source software reuse. Additionally, design patterns, i.e. well-known solution to common design problems, are introduced as elements of reuse. This study attempts to empirically investigate the reusability of design patterns, classes and software packages. Thus, the results can help developers to identify the most beneficial starting points for white box reuse, which is quite popular among open source communities. In order to achieve this goal we conducted a case study on one hundred (100) open source projects. More specifically, we identified 27,461 classes that participate in design patterns and compared the reusability of each of these classes with the reusability of the pattern and the package that this class belongs to. In more than 40{\%} of the cases investigated, design pattern based class selection, offers the most reusable starting point for white-box reuse. However there are several cases when package based selection might be preferable. The results suggest that each pattern has different level of reusability. },

  abstract = {This paper contributes an integrated survey of the work in the area of software inspection. It consists of two main sections. The first one introduces a detailed description of the core concepts and relationships that together define the field of software inspection. The second one elaborates a taxonomy that uses a generic development life-cycle to contextualize software inspection in detail. After Fagan's seminal work presented in 1976, the body of work in software inspection has greatly increased and reached measured maturity. Yet, there is still no encompassing and systematic view of this research body driven from a life-cycle perspective. This perspective is important since inspection methods and refinements are most often aligned to particular life-cycle artifacts. It also provides practitioners with a roadmap available in their terms. To provide a systematic and encompassing view of the research and practice body in software inspection, the contribution of this survey is, in a first step, to introduce in detail the core concepts and relationships that together embody the field of software inspection. This lays out the field key ideas and benefits and elicits a common vocabulary. There, we make a strong effort to unify the relevant vocabulary used in available literature sources. In a second step, we use this vocabulary to build a contextual map of the field in the form of a taxonomy indexed by the different development stages of a generic process. This contextual map can guide practitioners and focus their attention on the inspection work most relevant to the introduction or development of inspections at the level of their particular development stage; or to help motivate the use of software inspection earlier in their development cycle. Our work provides three distinct, practical benefits: First, the index taxonomy can help practitioners identify inspection experience directly related to a particular life-cycle stage. Second, our work allows structuring of the large amount of published inspection work. Third, such taxonomy can help researchers compare and assess existing inspection methods and refinements to identify fruitful areas of future work. },

  abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering paradigm is commonly used to manage variability and commonalities of business applications to satisfy a specific need or goal of a particular market. However, due to time and space complexity, combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) has been suggested to reduce the size of test suites. Although CIT is known as a promising approach to overcome these problems, there are still issues such as combinatorial explosion of features, which drains budget allocated for testing. Therefore, test case prioritization (TCP) is preferred to gain a better result in terms of producing an efficient detection of faults. Among prioritization techniques used in regression testing is similarity-based test case prioritization. Similarity-based test case prioritization rearranges test cases through calculation of distance between test cases using similarity measures. Result from the use of similarity measures in test case prioritization contributes to a much better testing process. This paper provides a comparison of selected similarity measures to investigate the feasibility and suitability of similarity measures to be used in SPL through experimentation. Jaccard, Hamming, Jaro-Winkler, Cosine similarity, Counting, and Sorensein distances have been chosen as similarity measures in this study. The result showed Jaro-Winkler as the best similarity measure with an 84.96{\%} Average Percentage of Faults Detected (APFD) value across eight feature models. The study offers insights on similarity measures in SPL context. Further, the paper concludes with suggestions on room for improvement, which could be achieved through experimentation and comparison studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract Global software development (GSD) is gaining ever more relevance. Although communication is key in the exchange of information between team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, {\{}IT{\}} infrastructure, etc.) and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic. Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD. The research question to which this study responds concerns how development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members, communication of the status of the development process, and communication of the status of the progress of the product under development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository tools, with information from the process development and product characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share information about the status of the project/process/product during the development process in order to overcome some of the still existing problems in communication in AGSD. },

In this paper we present an extension of the ABS toolchain with a mechanism for checking that all the variants of an SPL can be generated and are well-typed ABS programs. Currently we have implemented only part of this mechanism: our implementation (integrated in version 1.4.2 of the ABS toolchain and released in April 2017) checks whether all variants can be generated, however it does not check, in particular, whether the bodies of the methods are well-typed. Empirical evaluation shows that the current implementation allows for efficient partial type checking of existing ABS SPLs. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  abstract      = {AbstractContext Enterprise software systems (e.g., enterprise resource planning software) are often deployed in different contexts (e.g., different organizations or different business units or branches of one organization). However, even though organizations, business units or branches have the same or similar business goals, they may differ in how they achieve these goals. Thus, many enterprise software systems are subject to variability and adapted depending on the context in which they are used. Objective Our goal is to provide a snapshot of variability in large scale enterprise software systems. We aim at understanding the types of variability that occur in large industrial enterprise software systems. Furthermore, we aim at identifying how variability is handled in such systems. Method We performed an exploratory case study in two large software organizations, involving two large enterprise software systems. Data were collected through interviews and document analysis. Data were analyzed following a grounded theory approach. Results We identified seven types of variability (e.g., functionality, infrastructure) and eight mechanisms to handle variability (e.g., add-ons, code switches). Conclusions We provide generic types for classifying variability in enterprise software systems, and reusable mechanisms for handling such variability. Some variability types and handling mechanisms for enterprise software systems found in the real world extend existing concepts and theories. Others confirm findings from previous research literature on variability in software in general and are therefore not specific to enterprise software systems. Our findings also offer a theoretical foundation for describing variability handling in practice. Future work needs to provide more evaluations of the theoretical foundations, and refine variability handling mechanisms into more detailed practices.},

However, language composition is much easier to achieve with declarative formal language descriptions into which the notion of inheritance is introduced. Multiple attribute grammar inheritance, as implemented in the language implementation system LISA, can assist in realizing all of the different types of language compositions identified in Erdweg et al.

Assuring quality of feature models is thus of paramount importance for assuring quality in software product line engineering. However, feature models can have several types of defects that disminish benefits of software product line engineering.Two of such defects are dead features and false optional features. Several state-of-the-art techniques identify these defects, but only few of them tackle the problem of identifying their causes. Besides, the explanations they provide are cumbersome and hard to understand by humans. In this paper, we propose an ontological rule-based approach to: (a) identify dead and false optional features; (b)identify certain causes of these defects; and (c) explain these causes in natural language helping modelers to correct found defects. We represent our approach with a feature model taken from literature. A preliminary empirical evaluation of our approach over 31 FMs shows that our proposal is effective, accurate and scalable to 150 features. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a model that assists developers to evaluate and compare alternative reuse scenarios in software product line (SPL) development systematically in proposed. The model can identify basic activities (abstracted as operations) and precisely relate cost and reliability with each basic operation. A typical reuse mode is described from the perspectives of application and domain engineering. According to this scheme, six reuse modes are identified, and alternative industry reuse scenarios can be derived from these modes. A bi-objective 0-1 integer programming model is developed to help decision makers select reuse scenarios when they develop a SPL to minimize cost and maximize reliability while satisfying system requirements to a certain degree. This model is called the cost and reliability optimization under constraint satisfaction (CROS). To design the model efficiently, a three-phase algorithm for finding all efficient solutions is developed, where the first two phases can obtain an efficient solution, and the last phase can generate a nonsupported efficient solution. Two practical methods are presented to facilitate decision making on selecting from the entire range of efficient solutions in light of the decision-maker's preference for mancomputer interaction. An application of the CROS model in a mail server system development is presented as a case study. {\textcopyright} 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

For these reasons, it has been one of the most active research topics in software testing for several decades, resulting in many different approaches and tools. This paper presents an orchestrated survey of the most prominent techniques for automatic generation of software test cases, reviewed in self-standing sections. The techniques presented include: (a) structural testing using symbolic execution, (b) model-based testing, (c) combinatorial testing, (d) random testing and its variant of adaptive random testing, and (e) search-based testing. Each section is contributed by world-renowned active researchers on the technique, and briefly covers the basic ideas underlying the method, the current state of the art, a discussion of the open research problems, and a perspective of the future development of the approach. As a whole, the paper aims at giving an introductory, up-to-date and (relatively) short overview of research in automatic test case generation, while ensuring a comprehensive and authoritative treatment. },

  abstract  = {Over the last two decades, software product lines have been used successfully in industry for building families of systems of related products, maximizing reuse, and exploiting their variable and configurable options. In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Current software development methodologies recognize the critical importance of the architectural concerns during the design phase. Software Architecture promises to be the solution for a number of recurring problems; but to do so, the first task is to be able to obtain a precise description of a system architecture. In late years, a number of specific architecture description languages (Adls) have been proposed in order to achieve the required precision. Most of them have solid formal foundations; among them, several process-algebraic Adls stand out for their popularity and expressive power. The algebraic approach to architecture description is probably the most successful in the field. There is a natural intuition relating the concepts of algebraic process and architectural component; anyway, none of the existing approaches seems to have found the right balance between them. This article explains what is the problem with them, and defines the informal concept of abstract process, trying to provide a reference for the right level of abstraction. After presenting the concept, the article presents a dynamic, reflective Adl named P i L ar, which has been designed using this notion. The syntax and semantics of this language are briefly summarized and explained. Finally, the classic example of the Gas Station is described in terms of P i L ar, and then compared to previous presentations in other Adls. },

Neither domain engineering nor requirements engineering handles such co-evolution of requirements and contexts explicitly, making it especially hard to reason about the impact of co-changes in complex scenarios. Objective: In this paper, we propose a problem-oriented and value-based analysis method for variability evolution analysis. The method takes into account both kinds of changes (requirements and contexts) during the life of an evolving software product line. Method: The proposed method extends the core requirements engineering ontology with the notions to represent variability-intensive problem decomposition and evolution. On the basis of problemorientation, the analysis method identifies candidate changes, detects influenced features, and evaluates their contributions to the value of the SPL. Results and Conclusion: The process of applying the analysis method is illustrated using a concrete case study of an evolving enterprise software system, which has confirmed that tracing back to requirements and contextual changes is an effective way to understand the evolution of variability in the software product line. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Method We first present the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) to explicitly depict the studies that have considered the impact of experience curve effect on software development in general. Subsequently, based on the results of the SLR, the experience curve effect models in the literature, and the {\{}SPLE{\}} cost models, we define an approach for extending the cost models with the experience curve effect.

Thus, its ability to cope with customers' ever-changing requirements is among its key success factors. Great effort has been made to deal with the software product line evolution. In our previous works, we carried out a classification of these works to provide an overview of the used techniques. We also identified the following key challenges of software product lines evolution: the ability to predict future changes, the ability to define the impact of a change easily and the improvement in understanding the change. We have already tackled the second and the third challenges. The objective of this paper is to deal with the first challenge. We use the cladistics classification which was used in biology to understand the evolution of organisms sharing the same ancestor and their process of descent at the aim of predicting their future changes. By analogy, we consider a population of applications for media management on mobile devices derived from the same platform and we use cladistics to construct their evolutionary tree. We conducted an analysis to show how to identify the evolution trends of the case study products and to predict future changes. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors.},

We augment the prose documentation with executable test cases, including expected outputs, and use the prose plus the test cases as the documentation. With appropriate tool support, the test cases are easy to develop and read. Such test cases constitute a completely formal, albeit partial, specification of input/output behavior. Equally important, consistency between code and documentation is demonstrated by running the test cases. This approach provides an attractive bridge between formal and informal documentation. We also present a tool that supports compact and readable test cases, and generation of test drivers and documentation, and illustrate the approach with detailed case studies. },

In essence, these dashboards display information and enable users to reach insights and make informed decisions.

For these reasons, a domain engineering approach is proposed in order to produce customized dashboards adapted to singular requirements of every involved user (or group of users) by the parameterization of features, presentation components and data sources, obtaining a software product line of information dashboards. The creation of a product line would increase productivity, maintainability and traceability regarding the evolution of the dashboards' requirements.

In this contribution the authors compare two tree cutting strategies: the Dynamic Hybrid cut and the commonly used fixed height threshold. Two case studies have been performed on the source code of Philips Healthcare to compare the results using both approaches. While some of the settings are particular to the Philips-case, the results show that applying a dynamic threshold, implemented by the Dynamic Hybrid cut, is an improvement over the fixed height threshold in the detection of clusters representing relevant concerns. This makes the approach as a whole more usable in practice. },

However, conventional mechanisms have a number of limitations to support an effective identification and classification of crosscutting concerns in a software system. In this paper, we claim that those limitations are mostly caused by the fact that existing metrics and heuristics are not sensitive to primitive concern properties, such as either their degree of tangling and scattering or their specific structural shapes. This means that modularity assessment is rooted only at conventional attributes of modules, such as module cohesion, coupling and size. This paper proposes a representative suite of concern-sensitive heuristic rules. The proposed heuristics are supported by a prototype tool. The paper also reports an exploratory study to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed heuristics by applying them to seven systems. The results of this exploratory analysis give evidences that the heuristics offer support for: (i) addressing the shortcomings of conventional metrics-based assessments, (ii) reducing the manifestation of false positives and false negatives in modularity assessment, (iii) detecting sources of design instability, and (iv) finding the presence of design modularity flaws in both object-oriented and aspect-oriented programs. Although our results are limited to a number of decisions we made in this study, they indicate a promising research direction. Further analyses are required to confirm or refute our preliminary findings and, so, this study should be seen as a stepping stone on understanding how concerns can be useful assessment abstractions. We conclude this paper by discussing the limitations of this exploratory study focusing on some situations which hinder the accuracy of concern-sensitive heuristics. },

  abstract = {Abstract Mobile applications require dynamic reconfiguration services (DRS) to self-adapt their behavior to the context changes (e.g., scarcity of resources). Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) are a well-accepted approach to manage runtime variability, by means of late binding the variation points at runtime. During the system's execution, the {\{}DRS{\}} deploys different configurations to satisfy the changing requirements according to a multiobjective criterion (e.g., insufficient battery level, requested quality of service). Search-based software engineering and, in particular, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), can generate valid configurations of a {\{}DSPL{\}} at runtime. Several approaches use {\{}MOEAs{\}} to generate optimum configurations of a Software Product Line, but none of them consider {\{}DSPLs{\}} for mobile devices. In this paper, we explore the use of {\{}MOEAs{\}} to generate at runtime optimum configurations of the {\{}DSPL{\}} according to different criteria. The optimization problem is formalized in terms of a Feature Model (FM), a variability model. We evaluate six existing {\{}MOEAs{\}} by applying them to 12 different FMs, optimizing three different objectives (usability, battery consumption and memory footprint). The results are discussed according to the particular requirements of a {\{}DRS{\}} for mobile applications, showing that {\{}PAES{\}} and NSGA-II are the most suitable algorithms for mobile environments. },

However, PLA design is a people-intensive and non-trivial task, and to find the best architecture can be formulated as an optimization problem with many objectives. We found several approaches that address search-based design of software architectures by using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. However, such approaches have not been applied to PLAs. Considering such fact, in this work, we explore the use of these approaches to optimize PLAs. An extension of existing approaches is investigated, which uses specific metrics to evaluate the PLA characteristics. Then, we performed a case study involving one SPL. From the experience acquired during this study, we can relate some lessons learned, which are discussed in this work. Furthermore, the results point out that, in the case of PLAs, it is necessary to use SPL specific measures and evolutionary operators more sensitive to the SPL context. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Here we present an innovative approach to rationalise the product variety, i.e. to link each product variant to the customer profile who needs it. The aim is to optimise the product variety avoiding excesses (variants not related to a customer), lacks (customers not related to a variant) or redundancies (two or more variants proposed to a customer). An overview of customer modelling approaches in the classic product design (non-customisable) is presented. The innovative approach is here developed using system-thinking concepts. A knowledge-based system that uses this approach is designed. Finally the approach is explained using a real industrial case of a quasi-real coil design process.},

The case study shows several interesting results. The process of managing architectural changes as well as the information the architects maintain and update is surprisingly similar between the two companies, despite that one has a strong line organisation and the other a strong project organisation. The architecting process found does not differ from what can be seen in other business domains. What does differ is that the architects studied see themselves interacting much more with other stakeholders than architects in general. The actual architectures are based on similar technology, e.g. CAN, but the network topology, S/W deployment and interfaces are totally different. The results indicate how the company's different core values influence the architects when defining and maintaining the architectures over time. One company maintains four similar architectures in parallel, each at a different stage in their respective life-cycle, while the other has a single architecture for all products since 2002. The organisational belonging of the architects in the former company has been turbulent in contrast to the latter and there is some speculation if this is correlated. },

The quality attributes of a software system are, to a large extent determined by the system's software architecture. In recent years, the software engineering community has developed various tools and techniques that allow for design for quality attributes, such as performance or maintainability, at the software architecture level. We believe this design approach can be applied not only to âtraditionalâ quality attributes such as performance or maintainability but also to usability. This survey explores the feasibility of such a design approach. Current practice is surveyed from the perspective of a software architect. Are there any design methods that allow for design for usability at the architectural level? Are there any evaluation tools that allow assessment of architectures for their support of usability? What is usability? A framework is presented which visualizes these three research questions. Usability should drive design at all stages, but current usability engineering practice fails to fully achieve this goal. Our survey shows that there are no design techniques or assessment tools that allow for design for usability at the architectural level. },

  abstract = {Context Ambient Intelligence systems domain is an outstanding example of modern systems that are in permanent evolution, as new devices, technologies or facilities are continuously appearing. This means it would be desirable to have a mechanism that helps with the propagation of evolution changes in deployed systems. Objective We present a software product line engineering process to manage the evolution of FamiWare, a family of middleware for ambient intelligence environments. This process drives the evolution of FamiWare middleware configurations using cardinality-based feature models, which are especially well suited to express the structural variability of ambient intelligence systems. Method FamiWare uses cardinality-based feature models and clonable features to model the structural variability present in ambient intelligence systems, composed of a large variety of heterogeneous devices. Since the management evolution of configurations with clonable features is manually untreatable due to the high number of features, our process automates it and propagates changes made at feature level to the architectural components of the FamiWare middleware. This is a model driven development process as the evolution management, the propagation of evolution changes and the code generation are performed using some kind of model mappings and transformations. Concretely we present a variability modelling language to map the selection of features to the corresponding FamiWare middleware architectural components. Results Our process is able to manage the evolution of cardinality-based feature models with thousands of features, something which is not possible to tackle manually. Thanks to the use of the variability language and the automatic code generation it is possible to propagate and maintain a correspondence between the FamiWare architectural model and the code. The process is then able to calculate the architectural differences between the evolved configuration and the previous one. Checking these differences, our process helps to calculate the effort needed to perform the evolution changes in the customized products. To perform those tasks we have defined two operators, one to calculate the differences between two feature model configurations and another to create a new configuration from a previous one. Conclusion Our process automatically propagates the evolution changes of the middleware family into the existing configurations where the middleware is already deployed and also helps us to calculate the effort in performing the changes in every configuration. Finally, we validated our approach, demonstrating the functioning of the defined operators and showing that by using our tool we can generate evolved configurations for FamiWare with thousands of cloned features, for several case studies. },

One of the reasons for this can be extensive supplier and subcontractor relationships and the cost, effort or unpredictability of the deliverables from the subcontractors are experienced as a major problem. The paper proposes open software ecosystem as an alternative approach to develop software for embedded systems, and elaborates on the necessary quality attributes of an embedded platform underlying such an ecosystem. The paper then defines a reference architecture consisting of 17 key decisions together with four architectural patterns, and provides the rationale why they are essential for an open software ecosystem platform for embedded systems in general and automotive systems in particular. The reference architecture is validated through a prototypical platform implementation in an industrial setting, providing a deeper understanding of how the architecture could be realised in the automotive domain. Four potential existing platforms, all targeted at the embedded domain (Android, OKL4, {\{}AUTOSAR{\}} and Robocop), are evaluated against the identified quality attributes to see how they could serve as a basis for an open software ecosystem platform with the conclusion that while none of them is a perfect fit they all have fundamental mechanisms necessary for an open software ecosystem approach. },

  abstract      = {Context Scope management is a core part of software release management and often a key factor in releasing successful software products to the market. In a market-driven case, when only a few requirements are known a priori, the risk of overscoping may increase. Objective This paper reports on findings from a case study aimed at understanding overscoping in large-scale, market-driven software development projects, and how agile requirements engineering practices may affect this situation. Method Based on a hypothesis of which factors that may be involved in an overscoping situation, semi-structured interviews were performed with nine practitioners at a large, market-driven software company. The results from the interviews were validated by six (other) practitioners at the case company via a questionnaire. Results The results provide a detailed picture of overscoping as a phenomenon including a number of causes, root causes and effects, and indicate that overscoping is mainly caused by operating in a fast-moving market-driven domain and how this ever-changing inflow of requirements is managed. Weak awareness of overall goals, in combination with low development involvement in early phases, may contribute to âbiting off' more than a project can âchew'. Furthermore, overscoping may lead to a number of potentially serious and expensive consequences, including quality issues, delays and failure to meet customer expectations. Finally, the study indicates that overscoping occurs also when applying agile requirements engineering practices, though the overload is more manageable and perceived to result in less wasted effort when applying a continuous scope prioritization, in combination with gradual requirements detailing and a close cooperation within cross-functional teams. Conclusion The results provide an increased understanding of scoping as a complex and continuous activity, including an analysis of the causes, effects, and a discussion on possible impact of agile requirements engineering practices to the issue of overscoping. The results presented in this paper can be used to identify potential factors to address in order to achieve a more realistic project scope.},

Agile methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of teams on the same development programme. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories used in the development process. Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews, supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in data analysis. Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance. It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to specific activities within each of the agile roles. Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding ceremonies. },

  abstract = {Abstract Incorporating security features is one of the most important and challenging tasks in designing distributed systems. Over the last decade, researchers and practitioners have come to recognize that the incorporation of security features should proceed by means of a structured, systematic approach, combining principles from both software and security engineering. Such systematic approaches, particularly those implying some sort of process aligned with the development life-cycle, are termed security methodologies. There are a number of security methodologies in the literature, of which the most flexible and, according to a recent survey, most satisfactory from an industry-adoption viewpoint are methodologies that encapsulate their security solutions in some fashion, especially via the use of security patterns. While the literature does present several mature pattern-driven security methodologies with either a general or a highly specific system applicability, there are currently no (pattern-driven) security methodologies specifically designed for general distributed systems. Going further, there are also currently no methodologies with mixed specific applicability, e.g. for both general and peer-to-peer distributed systems. In this paper we aim to fill these gaps by presenting a comprehensive pattern-driven security methodology â arrived at by applying a previously devised approach to engineering security methodologies â specifically designed for general distributed systems, which is also capable of taking into account the specifics of peer-to-peer systems as needed. Our methodology takes the principle of encapsulation several steps further, by employing patterns not only for the incorporation of security features (via security solution frames), but also for the modeling of threats, and even as part of its process. We illustrate and evaluate the presented methodology in detail via a realistic example â the development of a distributed system for file sharing and collaborative editing. In both the presentation of the methodology and example our focus is on the early life-cycle phases (analysis and design). },

These features however make existing source code analysis tools unable to reason over this code. Consequently, all code analysis efforts of aspect-oriented code that we are aware of have either built limited analysis tools or were performed manually. Given the significant complexity of building them or manual analysis, a lot of duplication of effort could have been avoided by using a general-purpose tool. To address this, in this paper we present Gasr: a source code analysis tool that reasons over AspectJ source code, which may contain metadata in the form of annotations. {\{}GASR{\}} provides multiple kinds of analyses that are general enough such that they are reusable, tailorable and can reason over annotations. We demonstrate the use of {\{}GASR{\}} in two ways: we first automate the recognition of previously identified aspectual source code assumptions. Second, we turn implicit assumptions into explicit assumptions through annotations and automate their verification. In both uses {\{}GASR{\}} performs detection and verification of aspect assumptions on two well-known case studies that were manually investigated in earlier work. {\{}GASR{\}} finds already known aspect assumptions and adds instances that had been previously overlooked. },

The effectiveness of a software product line approach directly depends on how well feature variability within the portfolio is implemented and managed throughout the development lifecycle, from early analysis through maintenance and evolution. This article presents an approach that facilitates variability implementation, management, and tracing by integrating model-driven and aspect-oriented software development. Features are separated in models and composed of aspect-oriented composition techniques on model level. Model transformations support the transition from problem to solution space models. Aspect-oriented techniques enable the explicit expression and modularization of variability on model, template, and code level. The presented concepts are illustrated with a case study of a home automation system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The functional overlap of such products is an opportunity for future systematic reuse to reduce software development and maintenance costs. Therefore, we have tailored existing domain analysis methods to our organization to identify commonalities and variabilities among such products and to assess the potential for software product line (SPL) approaches. As an exploratory case study, we report on our experiences and lessons learned from conducting the domain analysis in four application cases with large-scale software products. We learned that the outcome of a domain analysis was often a smaller integration scenario instead of an SPL and that business case calculations were less relevant for the stakeholders and managers from the business units during this phase. We also learned that architecture reconstruction using a simple block diagram notation aids domain analysis and that large parts of our approach were reusable across application cases. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {A software product line is a unified representation of a set of conceptually similar software systems that share many common features and satisfy the requirements of a particular domain. Within the context of software product lines, feature models are tree-like structures that are widely used for modeling and representing the inherent commonality and variability of software product lines. Given the fact that many different software systems can be spawned from a single software product line, it can be anticipated that a low-quality design can ripple through to many spawned software systems. Therefore, the need for early indicators of external quality attributes is recognized in order to avoid the implications of defective and low-quality design during the late stages of production. In this paper, we propose a set of structural metrics for software product line feature models and theoretically validate them using valid measurement-theoretic principles. Further, we investigate through controlled experimentation whether these structural metrics can be good predictors (early indicators) of the three main subcharacteristics of maintainability: analyzability, changeability, and understandability. More specifically, a four-step analysis is conducted: (1) investigating whether feature model structural metrics are correlated with feature model maintainability through the employment of classical statistical correlation techniques; (2) understanding how well each of the structural metrics can serve as discriminatory references for maintainability; (3) identifying the sufficient set of structural metrics for evaluating each of the subcharacteristics of maintainability; and (4) evaluating how well different prediction models based on the proposed structural metrics can perform in indicating the maintainability of a feature model. Results obtained from the controlled experiment support the idea that useful prediction models can be built for the purpose of evaluating feature model maintainability using early structural metrics. Some of the structural metrics show significant correlation with the subjective perception of the subjects about the maintainability of the feature models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

MAS-PL promotes the large-scale reuse of common and variable agency features across multiple MAS applications. The development of MAS-PLs can be achieved through MAS-specific platforms and implementation techniques, such as conditional compilation and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). However, there is not much evidence on how these techniques provide better modularity, allowing the conception of stable MAS-PL designs. This paper presents a quantitative study on the design modularity and stability of an evolving MAS-PL. The MAS-PL was built following the reactive product line adoption approach. The product line was developed and evolved based on several versions of a conference management web-based system, named Expert Committee (EC). Our evaluation is made through a series of change scenarios related to new agency features, which are agent characteristics that enhance the system with autonomous behavior. The quantitative study consists of a systematic comparison between two different versions of the EC MAS-PL based on a MAS-specific platform, called JADE. One version was implemented with object-oriented and conditional compilation techniques. The other one relied on AOP. Our analysis was driven by well-known modularity and change impact metrics.},

Domain requirements are core domain asset in software product line engineering, and requirement analysis for domain products or solutions based on domain requirements is a key step. Previous domain requirement models are suitable to model tens of variabilities in a domain which contains only a limited number of products. But in a solution domain such as SDP (Service Delivery Platform) domain of telecom, there are thousands of variabilities among the solutions. In this paper, a new domain requirement model for solution domains is proposed. In this model, domain requirements are organized with three kinds of aggregation relationships and three kinds of generalization relationships. Based on these relationships, a configuration model is proposed to analyze the commonalities and variabilities among domain solutions. A solution requirement analysis method is also described based on the new domain requirement model. A case study is conducted on SDP domain which demonstrates how the proposed domain requirement model and solution requirement analysis method is used. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose to incorporate customer preference information into feature models using sentiment analysis of user-generated online product reviews. The proposed sentiment analysis method is a hybrid combination of affective lexicons and a rough-set technique. It is able to predict sentence sentiments for individual product features with acceptable accuracy, and thus augment a feature model by integrating positive and negative opinions of the customers. Such opinionated customer preference information is regarded as one attribute of the features, which helps to decide the number of variants needed within a product line. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed method via an application case of Kindle Fire HD tablets.},

To improve customer satisfaction, reduce lead-times and shorten costs, families of similar products are built jointly by combining reusable parts that implement the features demanded by the customers. To guarantee the validity of the products derived from mass customization processes, feature dependencies and incompatibilities are usually specified with a variability model. As market demand grows and evolves, variability models become increasingly complex. In such entangled models it is hard to identify which features are essential, dispensable, highly required by other features, or highly incompatible with the remaining features. This paper exposes the limitations of existing approaches to gather such knowledge and provides efficient algorithms to retrieve that information from variability models. },

The complexity of deriving a correct manual configuration of an arbitrary set of components, however, is a key source of system failures, downtime, and missed deadlines. This paper presents a model-driven engineering tool called Fresh that uses (1) feature models to codify the configuration rules of components, (2) a constraint solver to derive a correct application configuration, and (3) an XML annotation engine to inject configuration decisions from the constraint solver directly into an application configuration. We use an avionics mission computing case study based on the Lightweight CORBA Component Model (CCM) to (1) demonstrate the complexities of configuring components in/out of a component-based application and (2) motivate the reduction in the configuration complexity when Fresh is used.

Cloud providers offer many configuration options, such as location, purchasing mode, redundancy, and extra storage. Often, the information about such options is not well organised. This leads to large and unstructured configuration spaces, and turns the comparison into a tedious, error-prone search problem for the customers. In this work we focus on supporting customer decision making for selecting the most suitable cloud configurationâin terms of infrastructural requirements and cost. We achieve this by means of variability modelling and analysis techniques. Firstly, we structure the configuration space of an IaaS using feature models, usually employed for the modelling of variability-intensive systems, and present the case study of the Amazon EC2. Secondly, we assist the configuration search process. Feature models enable the use of different analysis operations that, among others, automate the search of optimal configurations. Results of our analysis show how our approach, with a negligible analysis time, outperforms commercial approaches in terms of expressiveness and accuracy. },

To generate fully implemented prototypes, these models require a rich representation of the semantics for actions (e.g., database persistence operations). In the development of some use case scenarios for the multi-layered development of web information systems, these design tasks may consume weeks of work even for experienced designers. The literature pointed out that the impossibility for executing a software project with short iterations hampers the adoption of some approaches for design in some contexts, such as start-up companies. A possible solution to introduce design tasks in short iterations is the use of automated design techniques, which assist the production of models by means of transformation tasks and refinements. This paper details our methodology for MDWE, which is supported by automated design techniques strictly associated with use case patterns of type CRUD. The novelty relies on iterations that are possible for execution with short time-scales. This is a benefit from automated design techniques not observed in {\{}MDWE{\}} approaches based on manual design tasks. We also report on previous experiences and address open questions relevant for the theory and practice of MDWE. },

A key part of an {\{}SPL{\}} is a model that captures the rules for reconfiguring the software. {\{}SPLs{\}} commonly use feature models to capture {\{}SPL{\}} configuration rules. Each {\{}SPL{\}} configuration is represented as a selection of features from the feature model.

When invalid configurations are created, a method is needed to automate the diagnosis of the errors and repair the feature selections. This paper provides two contributions to research on automated configuration of SPLs. First, it shows how configurations and feature models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems to automatically diagnose errors and repair invalid feature selections. Second, it presents empirical results from diagnosing configuration errors in feature models ranging in size from 100 to 5,000 features. The results of our experiments show that our CSP-based diagnostic technique can scale up to models with thousands of features. },

Although they follow different approaches to achieve it, some synergies can be found between them by (i) applying agile techniques to SPL activities so SPL development becomes more agile; and (ii) tailoring agile methodologies to support the development of SPL. Both options require an intensive use of feature models, which are usually strongly affected by changes on requirements. Changing large-scale feature models as a consequence of changes on requirements is a well-known error-prone activity. Since one of the objectives of agile methods is a rapid response to changes in requirements, it is essential an automated error analysis support in order to make SPL development more agile and to produce error-free feature models. As a contribution to find the intended synergies, this article sets the basis to provide an automated support to feature model error analysis by means of a framework which is organized in three levels: a feature model level, where the problem of error treatment is described; a diagnosis level, where an abstract solution that relies on Reiter's theory of diagnosis is proposed; and an implementation level, where the abstract solution is implemented by using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). To show an application of our proposal, a real case study is presented where the Feature-Driven Development (FDD) methodology is adapted to develop an SPL. Current proposals on error analysis are also studied and a comparison among them and our proposal is provided. Lastly, the support of new kinds of errors and different implementation levels for the proposed framework are proposed as the focus of our future work. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A case-by-case reviewing of each product description is a laborious and time-consuming task that fails to deliver a condense view of a family of product. In this article, we investigate the use of automated techniques for synthesizing a product comparison matrix (PCM) from a set of product descriptions written in natural language. We describe a tool-supported process, based on term recognition, information extraction, clustering, and similarities, capable of identifying and organizing features and values in a PCM â despite the informality and absence of structure in the textual descriptions of products. We evaluate our proposal against numerous categories of products mined from BestBuy. Our empirical results show that the synthesized PCMs exhibit numerous quantitative, comparable information that can potentially complement or even refine technical descriptions of products. The user study shows that our automatic approach is capable of extracting a significant portion of correct features and correct values. This approach has been implemented in MatrixMiner a web environment with an interactive support for automatically synthesizing PCMs from informal product descriptions. MatrixMiner also maintains traceability with the original descriptions and the technical specifications for further refinement or maintenance by users. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract A feature model is a compact representation of the products of a software product line. The automated extraction of information from feature models is a thriving topic involving numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Performance evaluations in this domain mainly rely on the use of random feature models. However, these only provide a rough idea of the behaviour of the tools with average problems and are not sufficient to reveal their real strengths and weaknesses. In this article, we propose to model the problem of finding computationally hard feature models as an optimization problem and we solve it using a novel evolutionary algorithm for optimized feature models (ETHOM). Given a tool and an analysis operation, {\{}ETHOM{\}} generates input models of a predefined size maximizing aspects such as the execution time or the memory consumption of the tool when performing the operation over the model. This allows users and developers to know the performance of tools in pessimistic cases providing a better idea of their real power and revealing performance bugs. Experiments using {\{}ETHOM{\}} on a number of analyses and tools have successfully identified models producing much longer executions times and higher memory consumption than those obtained with random models of identical or even larger size. },

  abstract = {Context A feature model (FM) represents the valid combinations of features in a domain. The automated extraction of information from {\{}FMs{\}} is a complex task that involves numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Current testing methods in this context are manual and rely on the ability of the tester to decide whether the output of an analysis is correct. However, this is acknowledged to be time-consuming, error-prone and in most cases infeasible due to the combinatorial complexity of the analyses, this is known as the oracle problem. Objective In this paper, we propose using metamorphic testing to automate the generation of test data for feature model analysis tools overcoming the oracle problem. An automated test data generator is presented and evaluated to show the feasibility of our approach. Method We present a set of relations (so-called metamorphic relations) between input {\{}FMs{\}} and the set of products they represent. Based on these relations and given a {\{}FM{\}} and its known set of products, a set of neighbouring {\{}FMs{\}} together with their corresponding set of products are automatically generated and used for testing multiple analyses. Complex {\{}FMs{\}} representing millions of products can be efficiently created by applying this process iteratively. Results Our evaluation results using mutation testing and real faults reveal that most faults can be automatically detected within a few seconds. Two defects were found in FaMa and another two in SPLOT, two real tools for the automated analysis of feature models. Also, we show how our generator outperforms a related manual suite for the automated analysis of feature models and how this suite can be used to guide the automated generation of test cases obtaining important gains in efficiency. Conclusion Our results show that the application of metamorphic testing in the domain of automated analysis of feature models is efficient and effective in detecting most faults in a few seconds without the need for a human oracle. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has been promoted as a means for handling the modularization of software systems by raising the abstraction level and reducing the scattering and tangling of crosscutting concerns. Studies from literature have shown the usefulness and application of {\{}AOP{\}} across various fields of research and domains. Despite this, research shows that {\{}AOP{\}} is currently used in a cautious way due to its natural impact on testability and maintainability. Objective To realize the benefits of {\{}AOP{\}} and to increase its adoption, aspects developed using {\{}AOP{\}} should be subjected to automated testing. Automated testing, as one of the most pressing needs of the software industry to reduce both effort and costs in assuring correctness, is a delicate issue in testing aspect-oriented programs that still requires advancement and has a way to go before maturity. Method Previous attempts and studies in automated test generation process for aspect-oriented programs have been very limited. This paper proposes a rigorous automated test generation technique, called RAMBUTANS, with its tool support based on guided random testing for the AspectJ programs. Results The paper reports the results of a thorough empirical study of 9 AspectJ benchmark programs, including non-trivial and larger software, by means of mutation analysis to compare {\{}RAMBUTANS{\}} and the four existing automated {\{}AOP{\}} testing approaches for testing aspects in terms of fault detection effectiveness and test effort efficiency. The results of the experiment and statistical tests supplemented by effect size measures presented evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique at 99{\%} confidence level (i.e. p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion The study showed that the resulting randomized tests were reasonably good for {\{}AOP{\}} testing, thus the proposed technique could be worth using as an effective and efficient AOP-specific automated test generation technique. },

Standards use the concept of Safety Integrity Levels (SILs) to drive the assignment of system safety requirements to components of a system under design.

Variation in design can indeed change the possible hazards incurred in each product, their causes, and can alter the safety requirements placed on individual components in different SPL products. Establishing common SILs for components of a large scale SPL by considering all possible usage scenarios, is desirable for economies of scale, but it also poses challenges to the safety engineering process.

As they integrate hard- and software elements, their functionality and reliability are often tested by hardware-in-the-loop methods, in which the system under test runs in a simulated environment. Due to the rising complexity of the embedded functions, performance limitations and practicability reasons, the simulations are often specialized to test specific aspects of the embedded system and develop a high diversity by themselves. This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and results in erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems in the test configuration. This paper presents a generative programming approach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibility issues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept. Furthermore, a novel model analyzer facilitates the efficient application in practice by migrating existing libraries.

The introduction of Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) has helped to meet these challenges by consolidating information about a system and providing a platform for modelling and analysis capabilities. However, managing this wealth of information can still be problematic, and evaluation of potential design decisions is still often performed manually. Automatic architectural optimisation can be used to assist this decision process, enabling designers to rapidly explore many different options and evaluate them according to specific criteria. In this paper, we present a multi-objective optimisation approach based on EAST-ADL, an {\{}ADL{\}} in the automotive domain, with the goal of combining the advantages of {\{}ADLs{\}} and architectural optimisation. The approach is designed to be extensible and leverages the capabilities of EAST-ADL to provide support for evaluation according to different factors, including dependability, timing/performance, and cost. The technique is applied to an illustrative example system featuring both hardware and software perspectives, demonstrating the potential benefits of this concept to the design of embedded system architectures. },

  abstract = {Abstract Context: Feature model is an appropriate and indispensable tool for modeling similarities and differences among products of the Software Product Line (SPL). It not only exposes the validity of the products' configurations in an {\{}SPL{\}} but also changes in the course of time to support new requirements of the SPL. Modifications made on the feature model in the course of time raise a number of issues. Useless enlargements of the feature model, the existence of dead features, and violated constraints in the feature model are some of the key problems that make its maintenance difficult. Objective: The initial approach to dealing with the above-mentioned problems and improving maintainability of the feature model is refactoring. Refactoring modifies software artifacts in a way that their externally visible behavior does not change. Method: We introduce a method for defining refactoring rules and executing them on the feature model. We use the {\{}ATL{\}} model transformation language to define the refactoring rules. Moreover, we provide an Alloy model to check the feature model and the safety of the refactorings that are performed on it. Results: In this research, we propose a safe framework for refactoring a feature model. This framework enables users to perform automatic and semi-automatic refactoring on the feature model. Conclusions: Automated tool support for refactoring is a key issue for adopting approaches such as utilizing feature models and integrating them into the software development process of companies. In this work, we define some of the important refactoring rules on the feature model and provide tools that enable users to add new rules using the {\{}ATL{\}} {\{}M2M{\}} language. Our framework assesses the correctness of the refactorings using the Alloy language. },

Recent research work has been exploring their integration, namely multi-agent systems product lines (MAS-PLs), to promote reuse and variability management in the context of complex software systems. However, current product derivation approaches do not provide specific mechanisms to deal with MAS-PLs. This is essential because they typically encompass several concerns (e.g., trust, coordination, transaction, state persistence) that are constructed on the basis of heterogeneous technologies (e.g., object-oriented frameworks and platforms). In this paper, we propose the use of multi-level models to support the configuration knowledge specification and automatic product derivation of MAS-PLs. Our approach provides an agent-specific architecture model that uses abstractions and instantiation rules that are relevant to this application domain. In order to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have implemented it as an extension of an existing product derivation tool, called GenArch. The approach has also been evaluated through the automatic instantiation of two MAS-PLs, demonstrating its potential and benefits to product derivation and configuration knowledge specification. },

  abstract = {Abstract The automotive industry is going through a fundamental change by moving from a mechanical to a software-intensive industry in which most innovation and competition rely on software engineering competence. Over the last few decades, the importance of software engineering in the automotive industry has increased significantly and has attracted much attention from both scholars and practitioners. A large body-of-knowledge on automotive software engineering has accumulated in several scientific publications, yet there is no systematic analysis of that knowledge. This systematic mapping study aims to classify and analyze the literature related to automotive software engineering in order to provide a structured body-of-knowledge, identify well-established topics and potential research gaps. The review includes 679 articles from multiple research sub-area, published between 1990 and 2015. The primary studies were analyzed and classified with respect to five different dimensions. Furthermore, potential research gaps and recommendations for future research are presented. Three areas, namely system/software architecture and design, qualification testing, and reuse were the most frequently addressed topics in the literature. There were fewer comparative and validation studies, and the literature lacks practitioner-oriented guidelines. Overall, research activity on automotive software engineering seems to have high industrial relevance but is relatively lower in its scientific rigor. },

Users want to be able to customize software behavior through reference to terms familiar to their diverse needs and experience. We present a requirements-driven approach to behavioral customization of software systems. Goal models are constructed to represent alternative behaviors that users can exhibit to achieve their goals. Customization information is then added to restrict the space of possibilities to those that fit specific users, contexts, or situations. Meanwhile, elements of the goal models are mapped to units of source code. This way, customization preferences posed at the requirements level are directly translated into system customizations. Our approach, which we apply to an on-line shopping cart system and an automated teller machine simulator, does not assume adoption of a particular development methodology, platform, or variability implementation technique and keeps the reasoning computation overhead from interfering with the execution of the configured application.},

  abstract = {Abstract Design patterns often need to be blended (or composed) when they are instantiated in a software system. The composition of design patterns consists of assigning multiple pattern elements into overlapping sets of classes in a software system. Whenever the modularity of each design pattern is not preserved in the source code, their implementation becomes tangled with each other and with the classes' core responsibilities. As a consequence, the change or removal of each design pattern will be costly or prohibitive as the software system evolves. In fact, composing design patterns is much harder than instantiating them in an isolated manner. Previous studies have found design pattern implementations are naturally crosscutting in object-oriented systems, thereby making it difficult to modularly compose them. Therefore, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has been pointed out as a natural alternative for modularizing and blending design patterns. However, there is little empirical knowledge on how {\{}AOP{\}} models influence the composability of widely used design patterns. This paper investigates the influence of using {\{}AOP{\}} models for composing the Gang-of-Four design patterns. Our study categorizes different forms of pattern composition and studies the benefits and drawbacks of {\{}AOP{\}} in these contexts. We performed assessments of several pair-wise compositions taken from 3 medium-sized systems implemented in Java and two {\{}AOP{\}} models, namely, AspectJ and Compose*. We also considered complex situations where more than two patterns involved in each composition, and the patterns were interacting with other aspects implementing other crosscutting concerns of the system. In general, we observed two dominant factors impacting the pattern composability with AOP: (i) the category of the pattern composition, and (ii) the AspectJ idioms used to implement the design patterns taking part in the composition. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Although {\{}SPEM{\}} 2.0 has great potential for software process modeling, it does not provide concepts or formalisms for precise modeling of process behavior. Indeed, {\{}SPEM{\}} fails to address process simulation, execution, monitoring and analysis, which are important activities in process management. On the other hand, {\{}BPMN{\}} 2.0 is a widely used notation to model business processes that has associated tools and techniques to facilitate the aforementioned process management activities. Using {\{}BPMN{\}} to model software development processes can leverage BPMN's infrastructure to improve the quality of these processes. However, {\{}BPMN{\}} lacks an important feature to model software processes: a mechanism to represent process tailoring. Objective This paper proposes BPMNt, a conservative extension to {\{}BPMN{\}} that aims at creating a tailoring representation mechanism similar to the one found in {\{}SPEM{\}} 2.0. Method We have used the {\{}BPMN{\}} 2.0 extensibility mechanism to include the representation of specific tailoring relationships namely suppression, local contribution, and local replacement, which establish links between process elements (such as in the case of SPEM). Moreover, this paper also presents some rules to ensure the consistency of {\{}BPMN{\}} models when using tailoring relationships. Results In order to evaluate our proposal we have implemented a tool to support the {\{}BPMNt{\}} approach and have applied it for representing real process adaptations in the context of an academic management system development project. Results of this study showed that the approach and its support tool can successfully be used to adapt BPMN-based software processes in real scenarios. Conclusion We have proposed an approach to enable reuse and adaptation of BPMN-based software process models as well as derivation traceability between models through tailoring relationships. We believe that bringing such capabilities into {\{}BPMN{\}} will open new perspectives to software process management. },

  abstract = {Feature Models (FMs) are a popular formalism for modeling and reasoning about the configurations of a software product line. As the manual construction of an FM is time-consuming and error-prone, management operations have been developed for reverse engineering, merging, slicing, or refactoring FMs from a set of configurations/dependencies. Yet the synthesis of meaningless ontological relations in the FM â as defined by its feature hierarchy and feature groups â may arise and cause severe difficulties when reading, maintaining or exploiting it. Numerous synthesis techniques and tools have been proposed, but only a few consider both configuration and ontological semantics of an FM. There are also few empirical studies investigating ontological aspects when synthesizing FMs. In this article, we define a generic, ontologic-aware synthesis procedure that computes the likely siblings or parent candidates for a given feature. We develop six heuristics for clustering and weighting the logical, syntactical and semantical relationships between feature names. We then perform an empirical evaluation on hundreds of FMs, coming from the SPLOT repository and Wikipedia. We provide evidence that a fully automated synthesis (i.e., without any user intervention) is likely to produce FMs far from the ground truths. As the role of the user is crucial, we empirically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of heuristics for computing ranking lists and different kinds of clusters. We show that a hybrid approach mixing logical and ontological techniques outperforms state-of-the-art solutions. We believe our approach, environment, and empirical results support researchers and practitioners working on reverse engineering and management of FMs. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Particularly, a tailored client program requires a tailored database schema as well to form a consistent IS. In this paper, we show the challenges of tailoring relational database schemas in software product lines.

Many of these applications have changing context and configurations at runtime to achieve functional and quality goals and can be realized as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs). {\{}DSPL{\}} constitutes an emerging but promising research area. Nevertheless, ensuring dependability in {\{}DSPLs{\}} remains insufficiently explored, especially in terms of reliability and maintainability.

Objective: To address this issue, we propose an approach to developing reliable and maintainable {\{}DSPLs{\}} in the context of the {\{}BSN{\}} domain. Method: Adaptation plans are instances of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) describing reliability goals and adaptability at runtime. These instances are automatically checked for reliability goal satisfiability before being deployed and interpreted at runtime to provide more suitable adaptation goals complying with evolving needs perceived by a domain specialist. Results: The approach is evaluated in the {\{}BSN{\}} domain. Results show that reliability and maintainability could be provided with execution and reconfiguration times of around 30Â ms, notification and adaptation plan update time over the network around 5Â s, and space consumption around 5Â MB. Conclusion: The method is feasible at reasonable cost. The incurred benefits are reliable vital signal monitoring for the patientâthus providing early detection of serious health issues and the possibility of proactive treatmentâand a maintainable infrastructure allowing medical {\{}DSL{\}} instance update to suit the needs of the domain specialist and ultimately of the patient. },

However, the design and implementation of such context-aware ubiquitous appplications remain challenging as there exist very few models and tools to guide application designers and developers in mastering the complexity of context information. This becomes even more crucial as context is by nature imperfect. One way to address this issue is to associate to context information meta-data representing its quality. We propose a generic and extensible design process for context-aware applications taking into account the quality of context (QoC). We demonstrate its use on a prototype application for sending flash sale offers to mobile users. We present extensive performance results in terms of memory and processing time of both elementary context management operations and the whole context policy implementing the Flash sale application. The cost of adding QoC management is also measured and appears to be limited to a few milliseconds. We show that a context policy with 120 QoC-aware nodes can be processed in less than 100 ms on a mobile phone. Moreover, a policy of almost 3000 nodes can be instantiated before exhausting the resources of the phone. This enables very rich application scenarios enhancing the user experience and will favor the development of new ubiquitous applications. },

At the same time, microkernel-based operating systems are being used to increase the reliability and trustworthiness of embedded systems. Since the microkernel approach to designing systems is partially based on the componentisation of system services, component-based software engineering is a particularly attractive approach to developing microkernel-based systems. While a number of widely used component architectures already exist, they are generally targeted at enterprise computing rather than embedded systems. Due to the unique characteristics of embedded systems, a component architecture for embedded systems must have low overhead, be able to address relevant non-functional issues, and be flexible to accommodate application specific requirements. In this paper we introduce a component architecture aimed at the development of microkernel-based embedded systems. The key characteristics of the architecture are that it has a minimal, low-overhead, core but is highly modular and therefore flexible and extensible. We have implemented a prototype of this architecture and confirm that it has very low overhead and is suitable for implementing both system-level and application level services.},

To date, platform ecosystems have been widely analyzed from the perspective of platform owners. However, how and to what extent app developers collaborate with their peers needs to be investigated further. In this article, we study the interfirm relationships among app developers in commercial platform ecosystems and explore the causes of variation in the network structure of these ecosystems. By means of a comparative study of four commercial platform ecosystems of Google (Google Apps and Google Chrome) and Microsoft (Microsoft Office365 and Internet Explorer), we illustrate substantial variation in the extent to which app developers initiated interfirm relationships. Further, we analyze how the degree of enforced entry barriers to the app store, the use of a partnership model, and the domain of the software platform that underpins the ecosystem affect the properties of these commercial platform ecosystems. We present subsequent explanations as a set of propositions that can be tested in future empirical research. },

  abstract = {Delivering great consumer experiences in competitive market conditions requires software vendors to move away from traditional modes of thinking to an outside-in perspective, one that shifts their business to becoming consumer-centric. Requirements engineers operating in these conditions thus need new means to both capture real preferences of consumers and then relate them to requirements for software customized in different ways to fit anyone. Additionally, because system development models require inputs that are more concrete than abstract, the indistinct values of consumers need to be classified and formalized. To address this challenge, this study aims to establish a conceptual link between preferences of consumers and system requirements, using software product line (SPL) as a means for systematically accommodating the variations within the preferences. The novelty of this study is a conceptual model of consumer preference, which integrates generic value frameworks from both psychology and marketing, and a method for its transformation to requirements for SPL using a goal-oriented RE framework as the mediator. The presented artifacts are grounded in an empirical study related to the development of a system for online education. {\textcopyright} 2013, The Author(s).},

Unlike workflow management, which uses predefined process control structures to determine what should be done during a workflow process, case handling focuses on what can be done to achieve a business goal. In case handling, the knowledge worker in charge of a particular case actively decides on how the goal of that case is reached, and the role of a case handling system is assisting rather than guiding her in doing so. In this paper, case handling is introduced as a new paradigm for supporting flexible business processes. It is motivated by comparing it to workflow management as the traditional way to support business processes. The main entities of case handling systems are identified and classified in a meta model. Finally, the basic functionality and usage of a case handling system is illustrated by an example. },

  abstract = {SPLE is a process to analyze a set of products and to identify the reusable components in the product family. And these components can be used for developing a new product in the product domain. Insurance sales system is software intensive system and the competitive power of software system determines the growth rate of business in insurance market. Sale system of insurance product is main target for improving their competition. Since the number of new insurance product is increasing and time-to-market is getting shorten, the needs for software product line engineering adoption is increased. As new insurance products are released, small-sized projects should be launched to add new software insurance products into existing information system. Since a software product module was implemented for each insurance product, there are so many redundant parts among the software insurance modules. Redundant codes make the problems in updating the already registered insurance products and make the cost of maintenance increasing. Software product line engineering can be the solution for redundancies in software systems and for reducing the cost of maintenance. To adopt the software product line to insurance sales system, 2 areas can be candidates (1) insurance sales system, (2) software insurance products. To smooth the adaptation, software insurance products is the first target for SPLE. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present two software tools for the simulation of electron multiplication processes in radio frequency (RF) waveguides. The electric discharges are caused by the multiplication of a small initial number of electrons. These are accelerated by the RF field and produce new electrons either by collisions with the walls of the waveguide (ripping new electrons from them), or by ionization of the neutral atoms of a gas inside the device. MEST allows simulating the Multipactor effect, a discharge produced in vacuum and generated by the collision of the electrons with the walls. CEST simulates the discharge when in addition a neutral gas is present in the waveguide, at pressures lower than ground levels (often denominated Corona discharge). The main characteristic of both tools is that they implement individual-based, microscopic models, where every electron is individually represented and tracked. In the case of MEST, the simulation is discrete-event, as the trajectory of each electron can be computed analytically. In CEST we use a hybrid simulation approach. The trajectory of each electron is governed by the Langevin stochastic differential equations that take into account a deterministic RF electric force and the random interaction with the neutral atom background. In addition, wall and ionizing collisions are modelled as discrete events. The tools allow performing batches of simulations with different wall coating materials and gases, and have produced results in good agreement with experimental and theoretical data. The different output forms generated at run-time have proven to be very useful in order to analyze the different discharge processes. The tools are valuable for the selection of the most promising coating materials for the construction of the waveguide, as well as for the identification of safe operating parameters.},

Three commonly faced patterns of changes incorporated in product lines and change management practices that mitigate their adverse effects are independencies among changes in variants, increasing the degree of evolving variance, and reinvented variations. Indepencies among change incorporated in different variants pose a problem in product line evolution, increasing variance results in numerous constraints across variation points, and it is often difficult to leverage existing implementations of variants. Some recommendations for change management include modularizing of change and variation points, tracking the scope and life of the variations, and facilitating reuse based on knowledge sharing.},

  abstract      = {AbstractContext Traditionally, Embedded Systems (ES) are tightly linked to physical products, and closed both for communication to the surrounding world and to additions or modifications by third parties. New technical solutions are however emerging that allow addition of plug-in software, as well as external communication for both software installation and data exchange. These mechanisms in combination will allow for the construction of Federated Embedded Systems (FES). Expected benefits include the possibility of third-party actors developing add-on functionality; a shorter time to market for new functions; and the ability to upgrade existing products in the field. This will however require not only new technical solutions, but also a transformation of the software ecosystems for ES. Objective This paper aims at providing an initial characterization of the mechanisms that need to be present to make a {\{}FES{\}} ecosystem successful. This includes identification of the actors, the possible business models, the effects on product development processes, methods and tools, as well as on the product architecture. Method The research was carried out as an explorative case study based on interviews with 15 senior staff members at 9 companies related to {\{}ES{\}} that represent different roles in a future ecosystem for FES. The interview data was analyzed and the findings were mapped according to the Business Model Canvas (BMC). Results The findings from the study describe the main characteristics of a {\{}FES{\}} ecosystem, and identify the challenges for future research and practice. Conclusions The case study indicates that new actors exist in the {\{}FES{\}} ecosystem compared to a traditional supply chain, and that their roles and relations are redefined. The business models include new revenue streams and services, but also create the need for trade-offs between, e.g., openness and dependability in the architecture, as well as new ways of working.},

Complementarily, the software maintainability is considered a software attribute playing an important role in quality level.

Consequently, the decision-making process about which metrics can be adopted in experiments on {\{}OOSM{\}} is a hard task. Therefore, a metrics' categorization has been proposed to facilitate this process. As result, 7 categories and 17 subcategories were identified. These categories represent the scenarios of {\{}OOSM{\}} metrics adoption, and a family of {\{}OOSM{\}} metrics catalog was generated based on the selection of a metrics' categorization. Additionally, a quasi-experiment was conducted to check the coverage index of the catalogs generated using our approach over the catalogs suggested by experts. 90{\%} of coverage was obtained with 99{\%} of confidential level using the Wilcoxon Test. Complementarily, a survey was conducted to check the experts' opinion about the catalog generated by the portal when they were compared by the catalogs suggested by them. Therefore, this evaluation can be the first evidences of the usefulness of the family of the catalogs based on the metrics' categorization. },

Cloud-computing is part of a new reality in which companies have at their disposal a high-capacity IT infrastructure at a low-cost, in which integration solutions can be deployed and run. The charging model adopted by cloud-computing providers is based on the amount of computing resources consumed by clients. Such demand of resources can be computed either from the implemented integration solution, or from the conceptual model that describes it. It is desirable that cloud-computing providers supply detailed conceptual models describing the variability of services and restrictions between them. However, this is not the case and providers do not supply the conceptual models of their services. The conceptual model of services is the basis to develop a process and provide supporting tools for the decision-making on the deployment of integration solutions to the cloud. In this paper, we review the literature on cloud configuration modelling, and compare current proposals based on a comparison framework that we have developed.},

However, these result in low recommendation accuracy. To create more accurate recommendations, we propose NavClus an approach that clusters navigation sequences from programmer interaction histories. NavClus automatically forms collections of code that are relevant to the tasks performed by programmers, and then retrieves the collections best matched to a programmer's current navigation path. This makes it possible to recommend the collections of code that are relevant to the programmer's given task. We compare NavClus' recommendation accuracy with TeamTracks' by simulating recommendations using 4397 interaction histories. The comparative experiment shows that the recommendation accuracy of NavClus is twice as high as that of TeamTracks. },

We conclude that proximity can provide a richer description of the relationships among the data and this offers a significant advantage when realizing clustering. We further motivate clustering relational proximity data and provide both synthetic and real-world experiments to demonstrate both the usefulness and advantage offered by clustering proximity data. Finally, a case study of relational clustering is introduced where we apply proximity fuzzy clustering to the problem of clustering a set of trees derived from software requirements engineering. The relationships between trees are based on the degree of closeness in both the location of the nodes in the trees and the semantics associated with the type of connections between the nodes. },

To address this issue, we conduct an empirical analysis on ten feature-oriented software product lines with respect to code cloning. We found that there is a considerable number of clones in feature-oriented software product lines and that a large fraction of these clones is FOP-related (i.e., caused by limitations of feature-oriented mechanisms). Based on our results, we initiate a discussion on the reasons for FOP-related clones and on how to cope with them.

However, metamodels are evolving over time, requiring existing domain models to be co-evolved. Though approaches have been proposed for performing such co-evolution automatically, those approaches typically support only specific metamodel changes. In this paper, we present a vision of co-evolution between metamodels and models through consistent change propagation. The approach addresses co-evolution issues without being limited to specific metamodels or evolution scenarios. It relies on incremental management of metamodel-based constraints that are used to detect co-evolution failures (i.e., inconsistencies between metamodel and model). After failure detection, the approach automatically generates suggestions for correction (i.e., repairs for inconsistencies). A case study with the {\{}UML{\}} metamodel and 23 {\{}UML{\}} models shows that the approach is technically feasible and also scalable. },

  abstract = {Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe an optimization approach to maximize collaboration in software process composition. The research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of composing processes for three software development projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable sequence of components. Findings: The main findings indicate that {\{}GA{\}} is more effective (best results regarding the fitness function) than {\{}HC{\}} and {\{}RS{\}} in the search of solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a context. These {\{}SBSE{\}} results were complemented by the feedback given by specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity, adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager during the decision making in process composition. Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample prevents generalization for other types of projects or different contexts. Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition, since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile, and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase collaboration in software development. Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally, this work expands the body of knowledge in {\{}SBSE{\}} to the field of software process which has not been properly explored by former research. },

  abstract = {Abstract Coordinating software reuse activities is a complex problem when considering collaborative software development. This is mainly motivated due to the difficulty in specifying how the artifacts and the knowledge produced in previous projects can be applied in future ones. In addition, modern software systems are developed in group working in separate geographical locations. Therefore, techniques to enrich collaboration on software development are important to improve quality and reduce costs. Unfortunately, the current literature fails to address this problem by overlooking existing reuse techniques. There are many reuse approaches proposed in academia and industry, including Framework Instantiation, Software Product Line, Transformation Chains, and Staged Configuration. But, the current approaches do not support the representation and implementation of collaborative instantiations that involve individual and group roles, the simultaneous performance of multiple activities, restrictions related to concurrency and synchronization of activities, and allocation of activities to reuse actors as a coordination mechanism. These limitations are the main reasons why the Reuse Description Language (RDL) is unable to promote collaborative reuse, i.e., those related to reuse activities in collaborative software development. To overcome these shortcomings, this work, therefore, proposes CollabRDL, a language to coordinate collaborative reuse by providing essential concepts and constructs for allowing group-based reuse activities. For this purpose, we extend {\{}RDL{\}} by introducing three new commands, including role, parallel, and doparallel. To evaluate CollabRDL we have conducted a case study in which developer groups performed reuse activities collaboratively to instantiate a mainstream Java framework. The results indicated that CollabRDL was able to represent critical workflow patterns, including parallel split pattern, synchronization pattern, multiple-choice pattern, role-based distribution pattern, and multiple instances with decision at runtime. Overall, we believe that the provision of a new language that supports group-based activities in framework instantiation can help enable software organizations to document their coordinated efforts and achieve the benefits of software mass customization with significantly less development time and effort. },

It is clear that new project techniques are demanded to support the design of such systems. At design phase, it is extremely important to raise abstraction level in earlier stages of product development in order to deal with such a complexity in an efficient way. This paper discusses Model Driven Engineering (MDE) applied to design industrial mechatronics systems. An aspect-oriented MDE approach is presented by means of a real-world case study, comprising requirements engineering up to code generation. An assessment of two well-known high-level paradigms, namely Aspect- and Object-Oriented paradigms, is deeply presented. Their concepts are applied at every design step of an embedded and real-time mechatronics system, specifically for controlling a product assembler industrial cell. The handling of functional and non-functional requirements (at modeling level) using aspects and objects is further emphasized. Both designs are compared using a set of software engineering metrics, which were adapted to be applied at modeling level. Particularly, the achieved results show the suitability of each paradigm for the system specification in terms of reusability quality of model elements. Focused on the generated code for each case study, statistics depicted an improvement in number of lines using aspects.},

Boxes have clear runtime boundaries that divide the objects of a box into objects that can be used to interact with the box (the boundary objects) and objects that are encapsulated and represent the state of the box (the local objects). The distinction into local and boundary objects is statically achieved by an ownership type system for boxes that uses domain annotations to classify objects into local and boundary objects and that guarantees that local objects can never be directly accessed by the context of a box. A trait is a set of methods divorced from any class hierarchy. Traits are units of fine-grained reuse that can be composed together to form classes or other traits. This paper integrates traits into an ownership type system for boxes. This combination is fruitful in two ways: it can statically guarantee encapsulation of objects and still provide fine-grained reuse among classes that goes beyond the possibilities of standard inheritance. It also solves a specific problem of the box ownership type system: namely that box classes cannot inherit from standard classes (and vice versa), and thus code sharing between these two kinds of classes was not possible in this setting so far. We present an ownership type system and the corresponding soundness proofs that guarantee encapsulation of objects in an object-oriented language with traits. },

However, there are some contradicting evidence in previous studies. For instance, some investigations found evidence that if the number of refactoring changes increases in the preceding time period the number of defects decreases, different from other studies. They have used different approaches to evaluate refactoring activities. Some of them identify committed behavior-preserving transformations in software repositories by using manual analysis, commit messages, or dynamic analysis. Others focus on identifying which refactorings are applied between two programs by using manual inspection or static analysis. In this work, we compare three different approaches based on manual analysis, commit message (Ratzinger's approach) and dynamic analysis (SafeRefactor's approach) to detect whether a pair of versions determines a refactoring, in terms of behavioral preservation. Additionally, we compare two approaches (manual analysis and Ref-Finder) to identify which refactorings are performed in each pair of versions. We perform both comparisons by evaluating their accuracy, precision, and recall in a randomly selected sample of 40 pairs of versions of JHotDraw, and 20 pairs of versions of Apache Common Collections. While the manual analysis presents the best results in both comparisons, it is not as scalable as the automated approaches. Ratzinger's approach is simple and fast, but presents a low recall; differently, SafeRefactor is able to detect most applied refactorings, although limitations in its test generation backend results for some kinds of subjects in low precision values. Ref-Finder presented a low precision and recall in our evaluation. },

Software adaptation decisions often involve comparing alternatives on two criteria: (1) how well a system meets users' requirements and (2) the effort required for adapting the system.

Common to both views is the notion of functionality, which software developers have traditionally used for effort estimation utilizing concepts such as function points. However, users involved in selecting systems are not necessarily familiar with such concepts. We propose an approach for comparing software functionality from users' point of view. The approach employs ontological concepts to define functionality in terms of system behaviors. To evaluate whether or not the approach is also usable by software developers, we conducted an exploratory experiment. In the experiment, software engineering students ranked descriptions of software systems on the amount of changes needed to adapt the systems to given requirements. The results demonstrated that the ontological approach was usable after a short training and provided results comparable to ranking done by expert software developers. We also compared the ontological approach to a method which employed function point concepts. The results showed no statistically significant differences in performance, but there seemed to be an advantage to the ontological approach for cases that were difficult to analyze. Moreover, it took less time to apply the ontological approach than the function point-based approach, and the difference was statistically significant. },

  abstract = {Context Reuse can improve productivity and maintainability in software development. Research has proposed a wide range of methods and techniques. Are these successfully adopted in practice? Objective We propose a preliminary answer by integrating two in-depth empirical studies on software reuse at two large software-producing companies. Method We compare and interpret the study results with a focus on reuse practices, effects, and context. Results Both companies perform pragmatic reuse of code produced within the company, not leveraging other available artefacts. Reusable entities are retrieved from a central repository, if present. Otherwise, direct communication with trusted colleagues is crucial for access. Reuse processes remain implicit and reflect the development style. In a homogeneous infrastructure-supported context, participants strongly agreed on higher development pace and less maintenance effort as reuse benefits. In a heterogeneous context with fragmented infrastructure, these benefits did not materialize. Neither case reports statistically significant evidence of negative side effects of reuse nor inhibitors. In both cases, a lack of reuse led to duplicate implementations. Conclusion Technological advances have improved the way reuse concepts can be applied in practice. Homogeneity in development process and tool support seem necessary preconditions. Developing and adopting adequate reuse strategies in heterogeneous contexts remains challenging.},

  abstract = {Web services are a reality for many businesses nowadays. The rules of these services are described on e-contracts (ECs). Therefore, monitoring is essential to ensure that the quality of service will be higher than agreed in the EC. This paper proposes an architecture for business process execution, where the monitor uses a fuzzy approach to predict an EC failure, and take actions to avoid it. With this prediction, the architecture changes service priority by running services with higher possibility (higher priority) of failure first. Nevertheless, if a failure happens, the architecture has a recovery module to recovery the service. Using the architecture, it is possible to observe an increase in the EC accomplishment (+40.41{\%}), and a decrease in the average response time of EC (-42.64{\%}). This paper compare two types of monitoring: light-weight monitoring (LWM) and heavy-weight monitoring (HWM). The results show that HWM is better than LWM in terms of performance. There was an improvement of 11.88{\%} in the EC accomplishment. The problem using the HWM is the reliability. It is not reliable. If the monitor fails, no monitoring is processed by the architecture. The results show that the architecture is promising.},

The emergence of more and more actors, without standards to provide their devices or OS, stops the cross-platform development. Indeed, a developer would have to learn many programmatic languages and create many user interfaces for many devices. To resolve this problem, several solutions often consist in the creation of a com- mon SDK to only write the application once. Then, the application code is translated in native code for each target platform. In this paper, we propose a solution based on a component model. A set of configurable components is implemented for the targeted platforms. A component will have a common interface independent from the host OS. Finally, a new language will offer developers a single instruction call to any component through its interface. This instruction is common on any platforms to simplify the implementation of a cross-platform application.},

  abstract = {Context It is important for Product Line Architectures (PLA) to remain stable accommodating evolutionary changes of stakeholder's requirements. Otherwise, architectural modifications may have to be propagated to products of a product line, thereby increasing maintenance costs. A key challenge is that several features are likely to exert a crosscutting impact on the {\{}PLA{\}} decomposition, thereby making it more difficult to preserve its stability in the presence of changes. Some researchers claim that the use of aspects can ameliorate instabilities caused by changes in crosscutting features. Hence, it is important to understand which aspect-oriented (AO) and non-aspect-oriented techniques better cope with {\{}PLA{\}} stability through evolution. Objective This paper evaluates the positive and negative change impact of component and aspect based design on PLAs. The objective of the evaluation is to assess how aspects and components promote {\{}PLA{\}} stability in the presence of various types of evolutionary change. To support a broader analysis, we also evaluate the {\{}PLA{\}} stability of a hybrid approach (i.e. combined use of aspects and components) against the isolated use of component-based, OO, and {\{}AO{\}} approaches. Method An quantitative and qualitative analysis of {\{}PLA{\}} stability which involved four different implementations of a PLA: (i) an {\{}OO{\}} implementation, (ii) an {\{}AO{\}} implementation, (iii) a component-based implementation, and (iv) a hybrid implementation where both components and aspects are employed. Each implementation has eight releases and they are functionally equivalent. We used conventional metrics suites for change impact and modularity to measure the architecture stability evaluation of the 4 implementations. Results The combination of aspects and components promotes superior {\{}PLA{\}} resilience than the other {\{}PLAs{\}} in most of the circumstances. Conclusion It is concluded that the combination of aspects and components supports the design of high cohesive and loosely coupled PLAs. It also contributes to improve modularity by untangling feature implementation. },

  abstract = {Software product lines enable developers to derive similar products from a common code base. Existing implementation techniques can be categorized as composition-based and annotation-based approaches, with both approaches promising complementary benefits. However, annotation-based approaches are commonly used in practice despite composition allowing physical separation of features and, thus, improving traceability and maintenance. A main hindrance to migrate annotated systems toward a composition-based product line is the challenging and time-consuming transformation task. For a company, it is difficult to predict the corresponding costs, and a successful outcome is uncertain. To overcome such problems, a solution proposed by the previous work is to use a hybrid approach, utilizing composition and annotation simultaneously. Based on this idea, we introduce a stepwise migration process from annotation-based toward composition-based approaches to lower the adoption barrier of composition. This process itself is independent of used implementation techniques and enables developers to incrementally migrate toward composition. We support our approach with detailed examples by partially migrating a real-world system. In detail, we describe the following: (1) our migration process, (2) its application on a real-world system, and (3) discuss practical challenges we face. We implemented the proposed approach and show that appropriate tool support helps to migrate toward composition-based product lines. Based on the case study, we show that the hybrid product lines work correctly and can compete with the performance of the original annotated system. However, the results also illustrate open issues that have to be solved to apply such migrations in practice. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

However, it disregards compositional aspects inherent to SPL development. This paper introduces Interface FTA (IFTA), which extends FTA with variable interfaces that restrict the way automata can be composed, and with support for transitions with atomic multiple actions, simplifying the design. To support modular composition, a set of Reo connectors are modelled as IFTA. This separation of concerns increases reusability of functionality across products, and simplifies modelling, maintainability, and extension of SPLs. We show how IFTA can be easily translated into FTA and into networks of Timed Automata supported by UPPAAL. We illustrate this with a case study from the electronic government domain. {\textcopyright} 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

This is because the use of pre-existing software requires the selection, composition and adaptation of prefabricated software parts, as well as the management of some complex problems such as guaranteeing high levels of efficiency and safety in critical domains. In addition to the wide variety of services, pervasive systems are composed of many networked heterogeneous devices with embedded software. In this work, we promote the safe reuse of services in service-based systems using two complementary technologies, Service-Oriented Architecture and Software Product Lines. In order to do this, we extend both the service discovery and composition processes defined in the DAMASCo framework, which currently does not deal with the service variability that constitutes pervasive systems. We use feature models to represent the variability and to self-adapt the services during the composition in a safe way taking context changes into consideration. We illustrate our proposal with a case study related to the driving domain of an Intelligent Transportation System, handling the context information of the environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To understand the underlying problems, we analyse several non-trivial software architectures.

Closer examination reveals that the absence of rigorously specified dependencies among models and the lack of support for automated composition of models are primary causes of management and consistency problems in software architecture. To tackle these problems, we introduce an approach in which compositions of models, together with relations among models, are explicitly supported in the ADL. We introduce these concepts formally and discuss a proof-of-concept instantiation of composition in xADL and its supporting tools. The approach is evaluated by comparing the original and revised {\{}ADs{\}} in an empirical study. The study indicates that our approach reduces the number of manually specified elements by 29{\%}, and reduces the number of manual changes to elements for several realistic change scenarios by 52{\%}. },

  abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) deals with developing artifacts that capture the common and variable aspects of software product families. Domain models are one kind of such artifacts. Being developed in early stages, domain models need to specify commonality and variability and guide the reuse of the artifacts in particular software products. Although different modeling methods have been proposed to manage and support these activities, the assessment of these methods is still in an inceptive stage. In this work, we examined the comprehensibility of domain models specified in ADOM, a UML-based SPLE method. In particular, we conducted a controlled experiment in which 116 undergraduate students were required to answer comprehension questions regarding a domain model that was equipped with explicit reuse guidance and/or variability specification. We found that explicit specification of reuse guidance within the domain model helped understand the model, whereas explicit specification of variability increased comprehensibility only to a limited extent. Explicit specification of both reuse guidance and variability often provided intermediate results, namely, results that were better than specification of variability without reuse guidance, but worse than specification of reuse guidance without variability. All these results were perceived in different UML diagram types, namely, use case, class, and sequence diagrams and for different commonality-, variability-, and reuse-related aspects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Such framework is facilitated by a holistic modeling approach that combines the capabilities of Object Process Methodology (OPM), Colored Petri Net (CPN) and feature model. The resultant holistic model not only can capture the structural, behavior, and dynamic aspects of a system, allowing strong analysis methods to be applied, but also can specify the architectural design space allowing generation of architecture alternatives that cover it. The proposed framework and suggested implementation is generic targeted at systems that can be specified by logic models using object-oriented paradigm. A partial implementation of the proposed approaches is presented with the design of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) as an example, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with the Genetic Algorithm (GA, particularly, NSGA-2) as the search algorithm.

It promotes the reuse of proven practices by providing analysts with a generic modeling artifact from which to derive individual process models. Unfortunately, the scope of existing notations for configurable process modeling is restricted, thus hindering their applicability. Specifically, these notations focus on capturing tasks and control-flow dependencies, neglecting equally important ingredients of business processes such as data and resources. This research fills this gap by proposing a configurable process modeling notation incorporating features for capturing resources, data and physical objects involved in the performance of tasks. The proposal has been implemented in a toolset that assists analysts during the configuration phase and guarantees the correctness of the resulting process models. The approach has been validated by means of a case study from the film industry. },

Coordination in Reo is performed by circuit-like connectors, which are constructed from primitive channels with well-defined behavior. These channels are mobile, i.e. can be dynamically created and reconfigured at run-time. Based on these language features, we introduce a high-level transformation system for Reo. We show how transformations of Reo connectors can be defined using the theory of high-level replacement (HLR) systems. This leads to a powerful notion of dynamic connector reconfiguration in Reo. Moreover, the rewrite rules are naturally expressed in Reo's visual syntax for connectors. Applications of this framework are manifold, due to the generality of the field of coordination. In this paper we provide an example from the area of Service-oriented Computing.},

  abstract = {Software product line (SPL) techniques handle the construction of customized systems. One of the most common representations of the decisions a customer can make in {\{}SPLs{\}} is feature models (FMs). An {\{}FM{\}} represents the relationships among common and variable features in an SPL. Features are a representation of the characteristics in a system that are relevant to customers. {\{}FMs{\}} are subject to change since the set of features and their relationships can change along an {\{}SPL{\}} lifecycle. Due to this evolution, the consistency of {\{}FMs{\}} may be compromised. There exist some approaches to detect and explain inconsistencies in FMs, however this process can take a long time for large FMs. In this paper we present a complementary approach to dealing with inconsistencies in {\{}FM{\}} evolution scenarios that improves the performance for existing approaches reducing the impact of change to the smallest part of an {\{}FM{\}} that changes. To achieve our goal, we formalize {\{}FMs{\}} from an ontological perspective and define constraints that must be satisfied in {\{}FMs{\}} to be consistent. We define a set of primitive operations that modify {\{}FMs{\}} and which are responsible for the {\{}FM{\}} evolution, analyzing their impact on the {\{}FM{\}} consistency. We propose a set of predefined strategies to keep the consistency for error-prone operations. As a proof-of-concept we present the results of our experiments, where we check for the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in {\{}FMs{\}} with thousands of features. Although our approach is limited by the kinds of consistency constraints and the primitive operations we define, the experiments present a significant improvement in performance results in those cases where they are applicable. },

State-of-the-art merging techniques are often limited to textual artifacts (e.g., source code) and they are unable to discover and resolve complex merging issues beyond simple conflicts. This work focuses on the merging of models where we consider not only conflicts but also arbitrary syntactic and semantic consistency issues. Consistent artifacts are merged fully automatically and only inconsistent/conflicting artifacts are brought to the users' attention, together with a systematic proposal of how to resolve them. Our approach is neutral with regard to who made the changes and hence reduces the bias caused by any individual engineer's limited point of view. Our approach also applies to arbitrary design or models, provided that they follow a well-defined metamodel with explicit constraintsâthe norm nowadays. The extensive empirical evaluation suggests that our approach scales to practical settings. },

However, we currently lack support for designing variability-intensive service-oriented systems. Such systems could be used in different environments, without the need to design them from scratch. To support the design of variability-intensive service-oriented systems, reference architectures that facilitate variability in instantiated service-oriented architectures can help. Objective The design of variability-intensive service-oriented reference architectures is subject to specific constraints. Architects need to know these constraints when designing such reference architectures. Our objective is to identify these constraints. Method An exploratory case study was performed in the context of local e-government in the Netherlands to study constraints from the perspective of (a) the users of a variability-intensive service-oriented system (municipalities that implement national laws), and (b) the implementing organizations (software vendors). We collected data through interviews with representatives from five organizations, document analyses and expert meetings. Results We identified ten constraints (e.g., organizational constraints, integration-related constraints) which affect the process of designing reference architectures for variability-intensive service-oriented systems. Also, we identified how stakeholders are affected by these constraints, and how constraints are specific to the case study domain. Conclusions Our results help design variability-intensive service-oriented reference architectures. Furthermore, our results can be used to define processes to design such reference architectures.},

Furthermore, due to increase in market competition and the dynamic nature of companies' emergence, several PLs may exist under the same roof. These PLs may be independently developed taking into consideration different sets of products and requirements. Thus the developed artifacts potentially have a different and partial view of the domain. Moreover, future development and maintenance of the different PLs may require consolidating the various artifacts into a single coherent one. In this work, we present a method for constructing domain knowledge through cross PL analysis. This method uses similarity metrics, text clustering, and mining techniques in order to create domain models and recommend on improvements to the existing PLs artifacts. Preliminary results reveal that the method outcomes reflect human perception of the examined domain. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Software systems have a strong impact on the energy consumption of the hardware they use. This is especially important for cyber-physical systems where power consumption strongly influences the battery life. For this reason, software developers should be more aware of the energy consumed by their systems. Moreover, software systems should be developed to adapt their behavior to minimize the energy consumed during their execution. This can be done by monitoring the usage context of the system and having runtime support to react to those changes that impact the energy footprint negatively. Although both the hardware and the software parts of cyber-physical systems can be adapted to reduce its energy consumption, this paper focuses on software adaptation. Concretely, the paper illustrates how to address the problem of developing context-aware energy-efficient applications using a Green Eco-Assistant that makes use of advanced software engineering methods, such as Dynamic Software Product Lines and Separation of Concerns. The main steps of our approach are illustrated by applying them to a cyber-physical system case study. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new style of product line engineering methods. It focuses on constructing embedded systems that take into account the contexts such as the external physical environments. In current product line development projects, Feature Analysis is mainly conducted from the viewpoint of system configurations: how hardware and software components are configured to constitute a system. In most cases, contexts are not considered explicitly. As a result, unexpected and unfavorable behavior might emerge in a system if a developer does not recognize any possible conflicting combinations between the system and contexts. To deal with this problem, this paper provides the notion of a context-dependent product line, which is composed of the system and context lines. The former is obtained by analyzing a family of systems. The latter is obtained by analyzing features of contexts associated to the systems. The system and context lines contain reusable core assets. The configuration of selected system components and contexts can be formally checked at the specification level. In this paper, we show a development process that includes the creation of both product line assets as well as context assets. },

Context-oriented programming (COP) has been recently proposed as a specialized programming paradigm for context-aware and adaptive systems. {\{}COP{\}} mostly focuses on run time adaptation of the application's behavior by supporting modular descriptions of behavioral variations. However, self-adaptive applications must satisfy additional requirements, such as distribution and concurrency, support for unforeseen changes and enforcement of correct behavior in the presence of dynamic change. Addressing these issues at the language level requires a holistic design that covers all aspects and takes into account the possibly cumbersome interaction of those features, for example concurrency and dynamic change. We present ContextErlang, a {\{}COP{\}} programming language in which adaptive abstractions are seamlessly integrated with distribution and concurrency. We define ContextErlang's formal semantics, validated through an executable prototype, and we show how it supports formal proofs that the language design ensures satisfaction of certain safety requirements. We provide empirical evidence that ContextErlang is an effective solution through case studies and a performance assessment. We also show how the same design principles that lead to the development of ContextErlang can be followed to systematically design contextual extensions of other languages. A concrete example is presented concerning ContextScala. },

Motivated by these benefits, many companies would like to adopt CD. However, adopting {\{}CD{\}} can be very challenging for a number of reasons, such as obtaining buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders whose goals may seemingly be different fromâor even conflict withâour own; gaining sustained support in a dynamic complex enterprise environment; maintaining an application development team's momentum when their application's migration to {\{}CD{\}} requires an additional strenuous effort over a long period of time; and so on. To help overcome the adoption challenges, I present six strategies: (1) selling {\{}CD{\}} as a painkiller; (2) establishing a dedicated team with multi-disciplinary members; (3) continuous delivery of continuous delivery; (4) starting with the easy but important applications; (5) visual {\{}CD{\}} pipeline skeleton; (6) expert drop. These strategies were derived from four years of experience in implementing {\{}CD{\}} at a multi-billion-euro company. Additionally, our experience led to the identification of eight further challenges for research. The information contributes toward building a body of knowledge for {\{}CD{\}} adoption. },

To deal with this problem, techniques for specifying and deriving product specific functional test cases have been proposed. However, there is little empirical evidence of the benefits and drawbacks of these techniques. To provide this kind of evidence, in a previous work we conducted an empirical study that compared two design techniques for black-box manual testing, a generic technique that we have observed in an industrial test execution environment, and a product specific technique whose functional test cases could be derived using any SPL approach that considers variations in functional tests. Besides revisiting the first study, here we present a second study that reinforce our findings and brings new insights to our investigation.

  abstract = {Abstract Considering that pair programming has been extensively studied for more than a decade, it can seem quite surprising that there is such a lack of consensus on both its best use and its benefits. We argue that pair programming is not a replacement of usual developer interactions, but rather a formalization and enhancement of naturally occurring interactions. Consequently, we study and classify a broader range of developer interactions, evaluating them for type, purpose and patterns of occurrence, with the aim to identify situations in which pair programming is likely to be truly needed and thus most beneficial. We study the concrete pair programming practices in both academic and industrial settings. All interactions between teammates were recorded as backup behavior activities. In each of these two projects, developers were free to interact when needed. All team interactions were self-recorded by the teammates. The analysis of the interaction tokens shows two salient features: solo work is an important component of teamwork and team interactions have two main purposes, namely cooperation and collaboration. Cooperative backup behavior occurs when a developer provides help to a teammate. Collaborative backup behavior occurs when the teammates are sharing the same goal toward solving an issue. We found that collaborative backup behavior, which occurred much less often, is close to the formal definition of pair programming. This study suggests that mandatory pair programming may be less efficient in organizations where solo work could be done and when some interactions are for cooperative activities. Based on these results, we discussed the potential implications concerning the best use of pair programming in practice, a more effective evaluation of its use, its potential benefits and emerging directions of future research. },

  abstract = {Agile software development provides a way to organise the complex task of multi-participant software development while accommodating constant project change. Agile software development is well accepted in the practitioner community but there is little understanding of how such projects achieve effective coordination, which is known to be critical in successful software projects. A theoretical model of coordination in the agile software development context is presented based on empirical data from three cases of co-located agile software development. Many practices in these projects act as coordination mechanisms, which together form a coordination strategy. Coordination strategy in this context has three components: synchronisation, structure, and boundary spanning. Coordination effectiveness has two components: implicit and explicit. The theoretical model of coordination in agile software development projects proposes that an agile coordination strategy increases coordination effectiveness. This model has application for practitioners who want to select appropriate practices from agile methods to ensure they achieve coordination coverage in their project. For the field of information systems development, this theory contributes to knowledge of coordination and coordination effectiveness in the context of agile software development. },

  abstract = {Abstract Cost-effective testing of a product in a product line requires obtaining a set of relevant test cases from the entire test suite via test selection and minimization techniques. In this paper, we particularly focus on test minimization for product lines, which identifies and eliminates redundant test cases from test suites in order to reduce the total number of test cases to execute, thereby improving the efficiency of testing. However, such minimization may result in the minimized test suite with low test coverage, low fault revealing capability, low priority test cases, and require more time than the allowed testing budget (e.g., time) as compared to the original test suite. To deal with the above issues, we formulated the minimization problem as a search problem and defined a fitness function considering various optimization objectives based on the above issues. To assess the performance of our fitness function, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation by investigating the fitness function with three weight-based Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and seven multi-objective search algorithms using an industrial case study and 500 artificial problems inspired from the industrial case study. The results show that Random-Weighted Genetic Algorithm (RWGA) significantly outperforms the other algorithms since {\{}RWGA{\}} can balance all the objectives together by dynamically updating weights during each generation. Based on the results of our empirical evaluation, we also implemented a tool called {\{}TEst{\}} Minimization using Search Algorithms (TEMSA) to support test minimization using various search algorithms in the context of product lines. },

In this paper, the authors present an approach to manage variability and requirements by using Feature Model (FM) and MBT. This paper focuses on modelling the integration towards enhancing product quality and reducing testing effort. Further, the authors considered coverage criteria, including pairwise coverage, all-state coverage, and all-transition coverage, in order to improve the quality of products. For modelling purposes, the authors constructed a mapping model based on variability in FM and behaviour from statecharts. The proposed approach was validated using mobile phone SPL case study. {\textcopyright} 2018 Authors.},

In order to better gauge the results of the hypotheses, the model is evaluated over economic environments at different stages of development. Social development and OSS growth were found to be the most important facilitators for eGovernment maturity, across countries of all stages of development. Institutional quality, technological openness, freedom in press and the macro-economic environment exerted different weights of importance across different country groupings. Findings also suggest that technological infrastructure and innovation are important drivers for OSS growth across countries at all stages of development.

Variability management of software is becoming an interesting topic for SMEs with expanding portfolios and increasingly complex product structures. While the use of software product lines to resolve high variability is well known in larger organizations, there is less known about the practices in SMEs. Objective: This paper presents results from a survey of software developing SMEs. The purpose of the paper is to provide a snapshot of the current awareness and practices of variability modeling in organizations that are developing software with the constraints present in SMEs. Method: A survey with questions regarding the variability practices was distributed to software developing organizations in a region of Sweden that has many SMEs. The response rate was 13{\%} and 25 responses are used in this analysis. Results: We find that, although there are SMEs that develop implicit software product lines and have relatively sophisticated variability structures for their solution space, the structures of the problem space and the product space have room for improvement. Conclusions: The answers in the survey indicate that SMEs are in situations where they can benefit from more structured variability management, but the awareness need to be raised. Even though the problem space similarity is high, there is little reuse and traceability activities performed. The existence of SMEs with qualified variability management and product line practices indicates that small organizations are capable to apply such practices. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This evolution should be conducted such that the extent of modifications required in ESS's structure is reduced.

  abstract = {Software Product Lines is a contemporary approach to software development that exploits the similarities and differences within a family of systems in a particular domain of interest in order to provide a common infrastructure for deriving members of this family in a timely fashion, with high-quality standards, and at lower costs. In Software Product Lines, feature-based product configuration is the process of selecting the desired features for a given software product from a repository of features called a feature model. This process is usually carried out collaboratively by people with distinct skills and interests called stakeholders. Collaboration benefits stakeholders by allowing them to directly intervene in the configuration process. However, collaboration also raises an important side effect, i.e., the need of stakeholders to cope with decision conflicts. Conflicts arise when decisions that are locally consistent cannot be applied globally because they violate one or more constraints in the feature model. Unfortunately, current product configuration systems are typically single-user-based in the sense that they do not provide means to coordinate concurrent decision-making on the feature model. As a consequence, configuration is carried out by a single person that is in charge of representing the interests of all stakeholders and managing decision conflicts on their own. This results in an error-prone and time-consuming process that requires past decisions to be revisited continuously either to correct misinterpreted stakeholder requirements or to handle decision conflicts. Yet another challenging issue related to configuration problems is the typically high computational cost of configuration algorithms. In fact, these algorithms frequently fall into the category of NP-hard and thus can become intractable in practice. In this paper, our goal is two-fold. First, we revisit our work on Collaborative Product Configuration (CPC) in which we proposed an approach to describe and validate collaborative configuration scenarios. We discuss how collaborative configuration can be described in terms of a workflow-like plan that safely guides stakeholders during the configuration process. Second, we propose a preliminary set of reasoning algorithms tailored to the feature modelling domain that can be used to provide automated support for product configuration. In addition, we compare empirically the performance of the proposed algorithms to that of a general-purpose solution. We hope that the insights provided in this paper will encourage other researchers to develop new algorithms in the near future. },

Within Software Product Lines (SPL), this activity is even more critical owing to the need to deal with common, variable, and product-specific requirements, not only for a single product but for the whole set of products. In this paper, we present a Feature-Driven Requirements Engineering approach (FeDRE) that provides support to the requirements specification of SPL. The approach realizes features into functional requirements by considering the variability captured in a feature model. It also provides detailed guidelines on how to associate chunks of features from a feature model and to consider them as the context for the Use Case specification. The evaluation of the approach is illustrated in a case study for developing an SPL of mobile applications for emergency notifications. This case study was applied within 14 subjects, 8 subjects from Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Val{\`{e}}ncia and 6 subjects from Federal University of Bahia. Evaluations concerning the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, effectiveness and efficiency as regards requirements analysts using the approach are also presented.

Quality assurance in product line engineering is a challenging task since a defect in a domain artifact may affect several products of the product line. Thus, proper quality assurance approaches need to pay special attention to the product line variability. Automation is essential to support quality assurance approaches. A prerequisite for automation is a profound formalization of the underlying control flow models and, in the context of SPLs, of the variability therein. In this paper, we propose a formal syntax and semantics for defining variability in Petri nets. We use these extended Petri nets as a foundation to formally define variability in UML activity diagrams; UML activity diagrams serve as a basis for several testing techniques in product line engineering. We illustrate the contribution of such a formalization to assurance activities in product line engineering by describing its usage in three application examples.},

  abstract = {Abstract Software architecture specifications are of growing importance for coping with the complexity of large-scale systems. They provide an abstract view on the high-level structural system entities together with their explicit dependencies and build the basis for ensuring behavioral conformance of component implementations and interactions, e.g., using model-based integration testing. The increasing inherent diversity of such large-scale variant-rich systems further complicates quality assurance. In this article, we present a combination of architecture-driven model-based testing principles and regression-inspired testing strategies for efficient, yet comprehensive variability-aware conformance testing of variant-rich systems. We propose an integrated delta-oriented architectural test modeling and testing approach for component as well as integration testing that allows the generation and reuse of test artifacts among different system variants. Furthermore, an automated derivation of retesting obligations based on accurate delta-oriented architectural change impact analysis is provided. Based on a formal conceptual framework that guarantees stable test coverage for every system variant, we present a sample implementation of our approach and an evaluation of the validity and efficiency by means of a case study from the automotive domain. },

  abstract = {Delta-oriented programming allows software developers to define software product lines as variations of a common code base, where variations are expressed as so-called program deltas. Monitor-oriented programming (MOP) provides a mechanism to execute functionality based on the execution history of the program; this is useful, e.g., for the purpose of runtime verification and for enforcing security policies. In this work we discuss how delta-oriented programming and MOP can benefit from each other in the Abstract Behavior Specification Language (ABS) through a new approach we call Delta-oriented Monitor Specification (DMS). We use deltas over monitor definitions to concisely capture protocol changes induced by feature combinations, and propose a notation to denote these deltas. In addition, we explore the design space for expressing runtime monitors as program deltas in ABS. A small case study shows that our approach successfully avoids code duplication in monitor specifications and that those specifications can evolve hand in hand with feature definitions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract      = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) investigates the development of systems involving the use of different types of sensors, which monitor activities and vital signs of lonely elderly people in order to detect emergency situations or deviations from desirable medical patterns. Instead of requiring the elderly person to manually push a button to request assistance, state-of-the-art {\{}AAL{\}} solutions automate the process by âperceiving' lonely elderly people in their home environment through various sensors and performing appropriate actions under the control of the underlying software. Dependability in the {\{}AAL{\}} domain is a critical requirement, since poor system availability, reliability, safety, or integrity may cause inappropriate emergency assistance to potentially have fatal consequences. Nevertheless, contemporary research has not focused on assessing dependability in this domain. This work attempts to fill this gap presenting an approach which relies on modern quantitative and qualitative dependability analysis techniques based on software architecture. The analysis method presented in this paper consists of conversion patterns from Unified Modeling Language (UML) behavior models of the {\{}AAL{\}} software architecture into a formal executable specification, based on a probabilistic process algebra description language, which enables a sound quantitative and qualitative analysis. The {\{}UML{\}} models specify system component interactions and are annotated with component failure probabilities and system usage profile information. The resulting formal specification is executed on PRISM, a model checking tool adequate for the purpose of our analysis in order to identify a set of domain-specific dependability properties expressed declaratively in Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic (PCTL). The benefits of using these techniques are twofold. Firstly, they allow us to seamlessly integrate the analysis during subsequent software lifecycle stages in critical scenarios. Secondly, we identify the components which have the highest impact on software system dependability, and therefore, be able to address software architecture and individual software component problems prior to implementation and the occurrence of critical errors.},

  abstract = {Disasters such as flooding, earthquake, famine and terrorist attacks might occur any time anywhere without prior warnings. In most cases it is difficult to predict when a disaster might occur however, well-planned disaster recovery procedures will reduce the intensity of expected consequences. When a disaster occurs, infrastructure based communications are most likely to be crippled, worsening the critical situation on hand. Wireless ad hoc and sensor network (WASN) technologies are proven to be valuable in coordinating and managing rescue operations during disasters. However, the increasing reliance on {\{}WASNs{\}} make them attractive to malicious attackers, especially terrorist groups, in a bid to hamper rescue operations amplifying the damage and increasing the number of casualties. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the fidelity of data traffic through {\{}WASN{\}} against malicious traffic disruption attacks. In this paper, we first demonstrate how {\{}WASN{\}} can be used in a well-planned disaster recovery effort. Then, we introduce and analyze one of the most severe traffic disruption attacks against WASNs, called Identity Delegation, and its countermeasures. Its severity lies in its capability to evade detection by even state-of-the-art intrusion detection techniques such as the neighbor monitoring based mechanisms. Through identity delegation, an adversary can drop packets, evade detection, and frame innocent nodes for dropping the traffic. We introduce a technique to mitigate identity delegation attack, dubbed Sadec, and compare it with the state-of-the-art mitigation technique namely Basic Local Monitoring (BLM) under a wide range of network scenarios. Our analysis which is validated by extensive ns-2 simulation scenarios show that {\{}BLM{\}} fails to efficiently mitigate packet drop through identity delegation attacks while Sadec successfully mitigates them. The results also show that Sadec achieves higher delivery ratios of data packets compared to BLM. On the other hand, the results show similar behavior in framing probabilities between Sadec and BLM. However, the desirable features of Sadec come at the expense of higher false isolation probabilities in networks with heavy traffic load and poor communication links. },

We review state-of-the-art package managers and their ability to keep up with evolution at the current growth rate of popular component-based platforms, and conclude that their dependency solving abilities are not up to the task. We show that the complexity of the underlying upgrade planning problem is NP-complete even for seemingly simple component models, and argue that the principal source of complexity lies in multiple available versions of components. We then discuss the need of expressive languages for user preferences, which makes the problem even more challenging. We propose to establish dependency solving as a separate concern from other upgrade aspects, and present {\{}CUDF{\}} as a formalism to describe upgrade scenarios. By analyzing the result of an international dependency solving competition, we provide evidence that the proposed approach is viable. },

This paper illustrates how aspect-orientation and model-driven development technologies can be used to enhance the system design phase; by automatically deriving detailed designs that take into account the âaspectsâ identified at the architectural level. Specifically, we have defined model-to-model transformation rules to automatically generate either aspect-oriented or object-oriented {\{}UML{\}} 2.0 models, closing the gap between {\{}ADLs{\}} and the notations used at the detailed design phase. By using AO-ADL it is possible to specify separately crosscutting concerns and base functionality. Another advantage of using AO-ADL is that it allows the specification of parameterizable architectures, promoting the definition of architectural templates. AO-ADL, then, enforces the specification of crosscutting concerns as separate architectural templates, which can be later instantiated and integrated with the core functionality of the system being developed. The AO-ADL language and the transformation rules from AO-ADL to {\{}UML{\}} 2.0 are available throughout the AO-ADL Tool Suite, which can be used to progressively refine and elaborate aspect-oriented software architectures. These refined architectures are the starting point of the detailed design phase. This means that our approach provides support to automatically generate a skeleton of the detailed design that preserves the information about the crosscutting and the non-crosscutting functionalities identified and modelled at the architecture level. },

It is important to select a minimum number of products but, at the same time, to consider the coverage of testing criteria such as pairwise, among other factors. To solve such problems Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied. However, to design a solution for this and other software engineering problems can be very difficult, because it is necessary to choose among different search operators and parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in this task, and have raised interest in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. Considering the growing adoption of {\{}SPL{\}} in the industry and crescent demand for {\{}SPL{\}} testing approaches, this paper introduces a hyper-heuristic approach to automatically derive products to variability testing of SPLs. The approach works with {\{}MOEAs{\}} and two selection methods, random and based on FRR-MAB (Fitness Rate Rank based Multi-Armed Bandit). It was evaluated with real {\{}FMs{\}} and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional algorithms used in the literature, and that both selection methods present similar performance. },

However, current approaches do not systematize the derivation process from the experiment definition to the concrete workflows and do not track the experiment provenance down to the workflow executions. Therefore, the composition, execution, and analysis for the entire experiment become a complex task. To address this issue, we propose the Algebraic Experiment Line (AEL). AEL uses a data-centric workflow algebra, which enriches the experiment representation by introducing a uniform data model and its corresponding operators. This representation and the AEL provenance model map concepts from the workflow execution data to the AEL derived workflows with their corresponding experiment abstract definitions. We show how AEL has improved the understanding of a real experiment in the bioinformatics area. By combining provenance data from the experiment and its corresponding executions, AEL provenance queries navigate from experiment concepts defined at high abstraction level to derived workflows and their execution data. It also shows a direct way of querying results from different trials involving activity variations and optionalities, only present at the experiment level of abstraction. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

In our analysis of this example, we show how design decisions accumulate and become invalid because of new requirements. Also it is argued that even an optimal strategy for designing the system (i.e. no compromises with respect to e.g. cost are made) does not lead to an optimal design because of unforeseen requirement changes that invalidate design decisions that were once optimal. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext The development of distributed software systems has become an important problem for the software engineering community. Service-based applications are a common solution for this kind of systems. Services provide a uniform mechanism for discovering, integrating and using these resources. In the development of service based applications not only the functionality of services and compositions should be considered, but also conditions in which the system operates. These conditions are called non-functional requirements (NFR). The conformance of applications to {\{}NFR{\}} is crucial to deliver software that meets the expectations of its users. Objective This paper presents the results of a systematic mapping carried out to analyze how {\{}NFR{\}} have been addressed in the development of service-based applications in the last years, according to different points of view. Method Our analysis applies the systematic mapping approach. It focuses on the analysis of publications organized by categories called facets, which are combined to answer specific research questions. The facets compose a classification schema which is part of the contribution and results. Results This paper presents our findings on how {\{}NFR{\}} have been supported in the development of service-based applications by proposing a classification scheme consisting in five facets: (i) programming paradigm (object/service oriented); (ii) contribution (methodology, system, middleware); (iii) software process phase; (iv) technique or mathematical model used for expressing NFR; and (v) the types of {\{}NFR{\}} addressed by the papers, based on the classification proposed by the ISO/IEC 9126 specification. The results of our systematic mapping are presented as bubble charts that provide a quantitative analysis to show the frequencies of publications for each facet. The paper also proposes a qualitative analysis based on these plots. This analysis discusses how {\{}NFR{\}} (quality properties) have been addressed in the design and development of service-based applications, including methodologies, languages and tools devised to support different phases of the software process. Conclusion This systematic mapping showed that {\{}NFR{\}} are not fully considered in all software engineering phases for building service based applications.

  abstract = {Pointcut fragility is a well-documented problem in Aspect-Oriented Programming; changes to the base-code can lead to join points incorrectly falling in or out of the scope of pointcuts. Deciding which pointcuts have broken due to base-code changes is a daunting venture, especially in large and complex systems. We present an automated approach that recommends pointcuts that are likely to require modification due to a particular base-code change, as well as ones that do not. Our hypothesis is that join points selected by a pointcut exhibit common structural characteristics. Patterns describing such commonality are used to recommend pointcuts that have potentially broken with a degree of confidence as the developer is typing. The approach is implemented as an extension to the popular Mylyn Eclipse IDE plug-in, which maintains focused contexts of entities relevant to the task at hand using a Degree of Interest (DOI) model. We show that it is accurate in revealing broken pointcuts by applying it to multiple versions of several open source projects and evaluating the quality of the recommendations produced against actual modifications. We found that our tool made broken pointcuts 2.14 times more interesting in the DOI model than unbroken ones, with a p-value under 0.1, indicating a significant difference in final DOI value between the two kinds of pointcuts (i.e., broken and unbroken).},

Of crucial importance in MVM is consistency checking - the description and verification of semantic relationships amongst the views. Variability is the capacity of software artifacts to vary, and its effective management is a core tenet of the research in Software Product Lines (SPL). MVM has proven useful for developing one-of-a-kind systems; however, to reap the potential benefits of MVM in SPL it is vital to provide consistency checking mechanisms that cope with variability. In this paper we describe how to address this need by applying Safe Composition - the guarantee that all programs of a product line are type safe.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a holistic modeling approach that combines the capabilities of Object Process Methodology (OPM), Colored Petri Net (CPN), and feature model. The resultant holistic model not only can capture the structural, behavioral, and dynamic aspects of a system, allowing simulation and strong analysis methods to be applied, it can also specify the architectural design space. This modeling approach is developed to facilitate the implementation of search-based system architecting where search algorithms are used to explore design trade space for good architecture alternatives. Such architecting approach integrates certain model construction, alternative generation, simulation, and assessment processes into a coherent and automated framework. Both the proposed holistic modeling approach and the search-based architecting framework are generic. They are targeted at systems that can be specified by conceptual models using object-oriented or process-oriented paradigms. The broad applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the configuration of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) under multi- objective optimization as an example. The test results showed that the proposed modeling approach could cover a huge number of architecture alternatives and supported the assessment of several performance measures. A set of quality results was obtained after running the optimization algorithm following the proposed search-based architecting framework. },

The selection of components, the G code preprocessor, different interpolation algorithms and various types of hardware options allow the user to build specific numerical controllers for each machine tool.

  abstract = {The trends toward product line development and toward adopting more third-party software are hard to combine. The reason is that product lines demand fine control over the software (e.g., for diversity management), while third-party software (almost by definition) provides only little or no control. A growing use of third-party software may therefore lead to less control over the product development process or, vice-versa, requiring large control over the software may limit the ability to use third-party components. Since both are means to reduce costs and to shorten time to market, the question is whether they can be combined effectively. In this paper, we describe our solution to this problem which combines the Koala component model developed within Philips with the concept of build-level components. We show that by lifting component granularity of Koala components from individual C files to build-level components, both trends can be united. The Koala architectural description language is used to orchestrate product composition and to manage diversity, while build-level components form the unit of third-party component composition. },

  abstract = {Abstract Configurable reference process models encompass common and variable processes of organizations from different business domains. These reference process models are designed and reused to guide and derive customized business processes according to the requirements of stakeholders. The customization process is generally initiated by a configuration step, selecting a subset of the reference process model. Configuration is followed by a customization step, which assumes adapting or extending the configured business process based on the specific or unforeseen requirements. Hence, it is crucial to validate the correctness and compliance of the final customized business process with respect to the patterns and business constraints that are specified in the reference model. In this paper, we firstly introduce a technique to develop a customized process model and then present a set of identified inconsistency patterns that may happen during the configuration of a reference model and the customization of configured process models. Furthermore, we describe our proposed approach including formal representations and algorithms that provide logical reasoning and enable automatic inconsistency detection by leveraging description logic. In order to explore the scalability of the approach, we designed the experiments with various process models sizes and inconsistency distributions. The results of the experiments revealed the scalability of our approach with large size process models (500 activities). },

  abstract = {Software-product-line engineering aims at the development of variable and reusable software systems. In practice, software product lines are often implemented with preprocessors. Preprocessor directives are easy to use, and many mature tools are available for practitioners. However, preprocessor directives have been heavily criticized in academia and even referred to as "{\#}ifdef hell", because they introduce threats to program comprehension and correctness. There are many voices that suggest to use other implementation techniques instead, but these voices ignore the fact that a transition from preprocessors to other languages and tools is tedious, erroneous, and expensive in practice. Instead, we and others propose to increase the readability of preprocessor directives by using background colors to highlight source code annotated with ifdef directives. In three controlled experiments with over 70 subjects in total, we evaluate whether and how background colors improve program comprehension in preprocessor-based implementations. Our results demonstrate that background colors have the potential to improve program comprehension, independently of size and programming language of the underlying product. Additionally, we found that subjects generally favor background colors. We integrate these and other findings in a tool called FeatureCommander, which facilitates program comprehension in practice and which can serve as a basis for further research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {Context Dependency management often suffers from labor intensity and complexity in creating and maintaining the dependency relations in practice. This is even more critical in a distributed development, in which developers are geographically distributed and a wide variety of tools is used. In those settings, different interpretations of software requirements or usage of different terminologies make it challenging to predict the change impact. Objective is (a) to describe a method facilitating change management in geographically distributed software engineering by effective discovery and establishment of dependency links using domain models; (b) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Method A domain model, providing a common reference point, is used to manage development objects and to automatically support dependency discovery. We propose to associate (annotate) development objects with the concepts from the model. These associations are used to compute dependency among development objects, and are stepwise refined to direct dependency links (i.e. enabling product traceability). To evaluate the method, we conducted a laboratory-based randomized experiment on two real cases. Six participants were using an implemented prototype and two comparable tools to perform simulated tasks. Results In the paper we elaborate on the proposed method discussing its functional steps. Results from the experiment show that the method can be effectively used to assist in discovery of dependency links. Users have discovered on average fourteen percent more dependency links than by using the comparable tools. Conclusions The proposed method advocates the use of domain models throughout the whole development life-cycle and is apt to facilitate multi-site software engineering. The experimental study and results suggest that the method is effective in the discovery of dependencies among development objects. },

A prerequisite for the design of a DSL is a detailed analysis and structuring of the application domain. Graphical feature diagrams have been proposed to organize the dependencies between such features, and to indicate which ones are common to all family members and which ones vary. In this paper, we study feature diagrams in more details, as well as their relationship to domain-specific languages. We propose the Feature Description Language (FDL), a textual language to describe features. We explore automated manipulation of feature descriptions such as normalization, expansion to disjunctive normal form, variability computation and constraint satisfaction. Feature descriptions can be directly mapped to UML diagrams which in their turn can be used for Java code generation. The value of FDL is assessed via a case study in the use and expressiveness of feature descriptions for the area of documentation generators.},

Objective: The main objective of the described work was to perform an {\{}SMS{\}} on {\{}DSLs{\}} to better understand the {\{}DSL{\}} research field, identify research trends, and any possible open issues. The set of research questions was inspired by a {\{}DSL{\}} survey paper published in 2005. Method: We conducted a {\{}SMS{\}} over 5 stages: defining research questions, conducting the search, screening, classifying, and data extraction. Our {\{}SMS{\}} included 1153 candidate primary studies from the {\{}ISI{\}} Web of Science and {\{}ACM{\}} Digital Library, 390 primary studies were classified after screening. Results: This {\{}SMS{\}} discusses two main research questions: research space and trends/demographics of the literature within the field of DSLs. Both research questions are further subdivided into several research sub-questions. The results from the first research question clearly show that the {\{}DSL{\}} community focuses more on the development of new techniques/methods rather than investigating the integrations of {\{}DSLs{\}} with other software engineering processes or measuring the effectiveness of {\{}DSL{\}} approaches. Furthermore, there is a clear lack of evaluation research. Amongst different {\{}DSL{\}} development phases more attention is needed in regard to domain analysis, validation, and maintenance. The second research question revealed that the number of publications remains stable, and has not increased over the years. Top cited papers and venues are mentioned, as well as identifying the more active institutions carrying {\{}DSL{\}} research. Conclusion: The statistical findings regarding research questions paint an interesting picture about the mainstreams of the {\{}DSL{\}} community, as well as open issues where researchers can improve their research in their future work. },

  abstract = {Abstract System performance improvements are critical for the resource-limited environment of multiple integrated applications executing inside a single distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) system, such as integrated avionics platform or vehtronics systems. While processor caches can effectively reduce execution time there are several factors, such as cache size, system data sharing, and task execution schedule, which make it hard to quantify, predict, and optimize the cache usage of a {\{}DRE{\}} system. This article presents SMACK, a novel heuristic for estimating the hardware cache usage of a {\{}DRE{\}} system, and describes a method of varying the runtime behavior of {\{}DRE{\}} system software without (1) requiring extensive safety recertification or (2) violating the real-time scheduling deadlines. By using {\{}SMACK{\}} as a maximization target, we were able to reduce integrated {\{}DRE{\}} system execution time by an average of 2.4{\%} and a maximum of 4.34{\%}. },

  abstract = {Abstract Web services run in complex contexts where arising events may compromise the quality of the whole system. Thus, it is desirable to count on autonomic mechanisms to guide the self-adaptation of service compositions according to changes in the computing infrastructure. One way to achieve this goal is by implementing variability constructs at the language level. However, this approach may become tedious, difficult to manage, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a solution based on a semantically rich variability model to support the dynamic adaptation of service compositions. When a problematic event arises in the context, this model is leveraged for decision-making. The activation and deactivation of features in the variability model result in changes in a composition model that abstracts the underlying service composition. These changes are reflected into the service composition by adding or removing fragments of Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) code, which can be deployed at runtime. In order to reach optimum adaptations, the variability model and its possible configurations are verified at design time using Constraint Programming. An evaluation demonstrates several benefits of our approach, both at design time and at runtime. },

  abstract = {Software product line engineering practices offer desirable characteristics such as rapid product development, reduced time-to-market, and more affordable development costs as a result of systematic representation of the variabilities of a domain of discourse that leads to methodical reuse of software assets. The development lifecycle of a product line consists of two main phases: domain engineering, which deals with the understanding and formally modeling of the target domain, and application engineering that is concerned with the configuration of a product line into one concrete product based on the preferences and requirements of the stakeholders. The work presented in this paper focuses on the application engineering phase and builds both the theoretical and technological tools to assist the stakeholders in (a) understanding the complex interactions of the features of a product line; (b) eliciting the utility of each feature for the stakeholders and hence exposing the stakeholders' otherwise implicit preferences in a way that they can more easily make decisions; and (c) dynamically building a decision model through interaction with the stakeholders and by considering the structural characteristics of software product line feature models, which will guide the stakeholders through the product configuration process. Initial exploratory empirical experiments that we have performed show that our proposed approach for helping stakeholders understand their feature preferences and its associated staged feature model configuration process is able to positively impact the quality of the end results of the application engineering process within the context of the limited number of participants. In addition, it has been observed that the offered tooling support is able to ease the staged feature model configuration process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has introduced several models and mechanisms for variability modeling and management. Dynamic software product lines (DSPL) engineering exploits the knowledge acquired in SPLE to develop systems that can be context-aware, post-deployment reconfigurable, or runtime adaptive. This paper focuses on DSPL engineering approaches for developing runtime adaptive systems and proposes a framework for classifying and comparing these approaches from two distinct perspectives: adaptation properties and adaptation realization.

  abstract = {Abstract Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are useful for a wide range of applications, from different domains. Recently, new features and design trends have emerged in the {\{}WSN{\}} field, making those networks appealing not only to the scientific community but also to the industry. One such trend is the running different applications on heterogeneous sensor nodes deployed in multiple {\{}WSNs{\}} in order to better exploit the expensive physical network infrastructure. Another trend deals with the capability of accessing sensor generated data from the Web, fitting {\{}WSNs{\}} in novel paradigms of Internet of Things (IoT) and Web of Things (WoT). Using well-known and broadly accepted Web standards and protocols enables the interoperation of heterogeneous {\{}WSNs{\}} and the integration of their data with other Web resources, in order to provide the final user with value-added information and applications. Such emergent scenarios where multiple networks and applications interoperate to meet high level requirements of the user will pose several changes in the design and execution of {\{}WSN{\}} systems. One of these challenges regards the fact that applications will probably compete for the resources offered by the underlying sensor nodes through the Web. Thus, it is crucial to design mechanisms that effectively and dynamically coordinate the sharing of the available resources to optimize resource utilization while meeting application requirements. However, it is likely that Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of different applications cannot be simultaneously met, while efficiently sharing the scarce networks resources, thus bringing the need of managing an inherent tradeoff. In this paper, we argue that a middleware platform is required to manage heterogeneous {\{}WSNs{\}} and efficiently share their resources while satisfying user needs in the emergent scenarios of WoT. Such middleware should provide several services to control running application as well as to distribute and coordinate nodes in the execution of submitted sensing tasks in an energy-efficient and QoS-enabled way. As part of the middleware provided services we present the Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous {\{}WSNs{\}} (SACHSEN) algorithm. {\{}SACHSEN{\}} is a new resource allocation heuristic for systems composed of heterogeneous {\{}WSNs{\}} that effectively deals with the tradeoff between possibly conflicting QoS requirements and exploits heterogeneity of multiple WSNs. },

  abstract = {Abstract Application-level multi-tenancy is an architectural approach for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications which enables high operational cost efficiency by sharing one application instance among multiple customer organizations (the so-called tenants). However, the focus on increased resource sharing typically results in a one-size-fits-all approach. In principle, the shared application instance satisfies only the requirements common to all tenants, without supporting potentially different and varying requirements of these tenants. As a consequence, multi-tenant SaaS applications are inherently limited in terms of flexibility and variability. This paper presents an integrated service engineering method, called service line engineering, that supports co-existing tenant-specific configurations and that facilitates the development and management of customizable, multi-tenant SaaS applications, without compromising scalability. Specifically, the method spans the design, implementation, configuration, composition, operations and maintenance of a SaaS application that bundles all variations that are based on a common core. We validate this work by illustrating the benefits of our method in the development of a real-world SaaS offering for document processing. We explicitly show that the effort to configure and compose an application variant for each individual tenant is significantly reduced, though at the expense of a higher initial development effort. },

Variability modeling, and in particular feature modeling, is a central element of model-driven software product line architectures. Such architectures often emerge from legacy code, but, creating feature models from large, legacy systems is a long and arduous task. We describe three synthesis scenarios that can benefit from the algorithms in this paper.
Objective
This paper addresses the problem of automatic synthesis of feature models from propositional constraints. We show that the decision version of the problem is NP-hard. We designed two efficient algorithms for synthesis of feature models from CNF and DNF formulas respectively.
Method
We performed an experimental evaluation of the algorithms against a binary decision diagram (BDD)-based approach and a formal concept analysis (FCA)-based approach using models derived from realistic models.
Results
Our evaluation shows a 10 to 1,000-fold performance improvement for our algorithms over the BDD-based approach. The performance of the DNF-based algorithm was similar to the FCA-based approach, with advantages for both techniques. We identified input properties that affect the runtimes of the CNF- and DNF-based algorithms.
Conclusions
Our algorithms are the first known techniques that are efficient enough to be used on dependencies extracted from real systems, opening new possibilities of creating reverse engineering and model management tools for variability models.},

In this paper, we present an idea for efficient verification of evolving software product lines, by reusing the result of verification and state space of the product family. To this end, we generate the state space of the product family once and verify the desired properties. The result of verification is the set of products satisfying the given properties. When the product line evolves, we may use the result of verification, and the state space to produce new results, and update the existing state space. We show the applicability of our approach by applying it on a small case study. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

However, empirical assessments to investigate those benefits have mostly focused on source code, and thus, the relevance of modularity to earlier artifacts is still not so clear (such as requirements and design models). In this paper, we use a multimethod technique, including designed experiments, to empirically evaluate the benefits of modularity in the context of two approaches for specifying product line use case scenarios: PLUSS and MSVCM. The first uses an annotative approach for specifying variability, whereas the second relies on aspect-oriented constructs for separating common and variant scenario specifications. After evaluating these approaches through the specifications of several systems, we find out that MSVCM reduces feature scattering and improves scenario cohesion. These results suggest that evolving a product line specification using MSVCM requires only localized changes. On the other hand, the results of six experiments reveal that MSVCM requires more time to derive the product line specifications and, contrasting with the modularity results, reduces the time to evolve a product line specification only when the subjects have been well trained and are used to the task of evolving product line specifications. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Context The software product line engineering (SPLE) community has provided several different approaches for assessing the feasibility of SPLE adoption and selecting transition strategies. These approaches usually include many rules and guidelines which are very often implicit or scattered over different publications. Hence, for the practitioners it is not always easy to select and use these rules to support the decision making process. Even in case the rules are known, the lack of automated support for storing and executing the rules seriously impedes the decision making process. Objective We aim to evaluate the impact of a decision support system (DSS) on decision-making in SPLE adoption. In alignment with this goal, we provide a decision support model (DSM) and the corresponding DSS. Method First, we apply a systematic literature review (SLR) on the existing primary studies that discuss and present approaches for analyzing the feasibility of SPLE adoption and transition strategies. Second, based on the data extraction and synthesis activities of the SLR, the required questions and rules are derived and implemented in the DSS. Third, for validation of the approach we conduct multiple case studies. Results In the course of the SLR, 31 primary studies were identified from which we could construct 25 aspects, 39 questions and 312 rules. We have developed the DSS tool Transit-PL that embodies these elements. Conclusions The multiple case study validation showed that the adoption of the developed DSS tool is justified to support the decision making process in SPLE adoption. {\textcopyright}2015 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Context
Feature models are commonly used to capture and communicate the commonality and variability of features in a Software Product Line. The core component of Feature models is feature diagrams, which graphically depict features in a hierarchical form. In previous work we have proposed a new notation that aims to improve the cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to empirically validate the cognitive effectiveness of the new feature diagrams notation in comparison to its original form.
Methods
We use two distinct empirical user-studies to validate the new notation. The first empirical study uses the survey approach while the second study is a subject-based experiment. The survey study investigates the semantic transparency of the new notation while the second study investigates the speed and accuracy of reading the notation.
Results
The results of the studies indicate that the proposed changes have significantly improved its cognitive effectiveness.
Conclusions
The cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams has been improved, however there remains further research for full acceptance of the new notation by its potential user community.},

  abstract = {Web applications should be usable in order to be accepted by users and to improve their success probability. Despite the fact that this requirement has promoted the emergence of several usability evaluation methods, there is a need for empirically validated methods that provide evidence about their effectiveness and that can be properly integrated into early stages of Web development processes. Model-driven Web development processes have grown in popularity over the last few years, and offer a suitable context in which to perform early usability evaluations due to their intrinsic traceability mechanisms. These issues have motivated us to propose a Web Usability Evaluation Process (WUEP) which can be integrated into model-driven Web development processes. This paper presents a family of experiments that we have carried out to empirically validate WUEP. The family of experiments was carried out by 64 participants, including PhD and Master's computer science students. The objective of the experiments was to evaluate the participants' effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use and perceived satisfaction when using {\{}WUEP{\}} in comparison to an industrial widely used inspection method: Heuristic Evaluation (HE). The statistical analysis and meta-analysis of the data obtained separately from each experiment indicated that {\{}WUEP{\}} is more effective and efficient than {\{}HE{\}} in the detection of usability problems. The evaluators were also more satisfied when applying WUEP, and found it easier to use than HE. Although further experiments must be carried out to strengthen these results, {\{}WUEP{\}} has proved to be a promising usability inspection method for Web applications which have been developed by using model-driven development processes. },

The use of {\{}IR{\}} requires choosing an appropriate retrieval model and deciding on a query that best captures a particular information need. Taking feature location as a representative example, three research questions are investigated: (1) the impact of query preprocessing, (2) the impact that different scraping techniques for queries have on retrieval performance, (3) the performance impact that the underlying retrieval model has on identifying the correct source-code functions (the correct documents). These research questions are addressed using the five open source projects released as part of the {\{}SEMERU{\}} dataset. In the experiments, five methods of scraping queries from modification requests and seven retrieval model instances are considered. Using the standard evaluation metric Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), the experimental analysis reveals that better retrieval models are not the ones commonly used by software engineering researchers. Results find that models based on query-likelihood perform about twice as well as models in common use in software engineering such as {\{}LSI{\}} and thus deserve greater attention. Furthermore, corpus preprocessing has a significant impact as the top performing setting is over 100{\%} better than the average. },

In these emerging fields, there is a need for computerized systems to have a higher understanding of the situations in which to provide services or functionalities, to adapt accordingly. The literature shows that researchers modify existing engineering methods in order to better fit the needs of context-aware computing. These efforts are typically disconnected from each other and generally focus on solving specific development issues. We encourage the creation of a more holistic and unified engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these systems. For this purpose, we study the state-of-the-art in the development of context-aware systems, focusing on: (A) Methodologies for developing context-aware systems, analyzing the reasons behind their lack of adoption and features that the community wish they can use; (B) Context-aware system engineering challenges and techniques applied during the most common development stages; (C) Context-aware systems conceptualization. },

At the same time, pervasive middleware should provide extended dependability via self-management capabilities, to conduct self-diagnosis of possible malfunctions using the current runtime context, and self-configuration and self-adaptation when there are service mismatches. In this article, we present an approach to combine the power of {\{}BDI{\}} practical reasoning and OWL/SWRL ontologies theoretical reasoning in order to improve the intelligence of pervasive middleware, supported by a set of Self-Management Pervasive Service (SeMaPS) ontologies featuring dynamic context, complex context, and self-management rules modeling. In this approach, belief sets are enriched with the results of OWL/SWRL theoretical reasoning to derive beliefs that cannot be obtained directly or explicitly. This is demonstrated with agents negotiating sports appointments. To cope with self-management, the corresponding monitoring, configuration, adaptation and diagnosis rules are developed based on {\{}OWL{\}} and {\{}SWRL{\}} utilizing SeMaPS ontologies. Evaluations show this combined reasoning approach can perform well, and that Semantic Web-based self-management is promising for pervasive computing environments. },

Similarly, reusable cluster-based test cases can be generated using the framework hooks, and they, too, can be provided with the framework to reduce the cluster testing time and effort of the framework applications. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to estimate the possible coverage of the cluster-based reusable test cases for framework applications prior to suggesting and applying a specific technique to produce the test cases. An experimental case study is conducted to demonstrate the practical issues in applying the introduced methodology and to give insights on the possible coverage of the framework reusable cluster-based test cases. The results of applying the methodology on five framework applications show that, on average, the reusable cluster-based test cases cover at least one-third of the cluster testing areas of the interface classes created during the framework application engineering stage. },

However, its benefits and limitations have not been empirically evaluated up to now. In this paper, we evaluate TVL with four cases from companies of different sizes and application domains. The study shows that practitioners can benefit from TVL. The participants appreciated the notation, the advantages of a textual language and considered the learning curve to be gentle. The study also reveals some limitations of the current version of TVL. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Abstract Software refactoring is a well-known technique that provides transformations on software artifacts with the aim of improving their overall quality. We have previously proposed a catalog of refactorings for spreadsheet models expressed in the ClassSheets modeling language, which allows us to specify the business logic of a spreadsheet in an object-oriented fashion. Reasoning about spreadsheets at the model level enhances a model-driven spreadsheet environment where a ClassSheet model and its conforming instance (spreadsheet data) automatically co-evolves after applying a refactoring at the model level. Research motivation was to improve the model and its conforming instance: the spreadsheet data. In this paper we define such refactorings using previously proposed evolution steps for models and instances. We also present an empirical study we designed and conducted in order to confirm our original intuition that these refactorings have a positive impact on end-user productivity, both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The results are not only presented in terms of productivity changes between refactored and non-refactored scenarios, but also the overall user satisfaction, relevance, and experience. In almost all cases the refactorings improved end-users productivity. Moreover, in most cases users were more engaged with the refactored version of the spreadsheets they worked with. },

  abstract = {Abstract Architectural decisions determine the ability of the implemented system to satisfy functional and quality attribute requirements. The Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style has been extensively used recently for integrating services and applications. Its adoption to build SOA-based distributed systems brings several benefits, but also poses new challenges and risks. Particularly important among those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. A proved efficient technique to identify and help mitigate those risks is the architecture evaluation. In this paper we propose an approach, tooling, and guidelines to aid architecture evaluation activities in REST-based systems. These guidelines can be systematically used along with evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and tradeoffs. To demonstrate how the guidelines can help architecture evaluators, we present a proof of concept describing how to use the guidelines in an {\{}ATAM{\}} (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) evaluation. We also present the results of a survey conducted with industry specialists who have performed architecture evaluations in real world REST-based systems in order to gauge the suitability and utility of the proposed guidelines. Finally, the paper describes a Web tool developed to facilitate the use of the evaluation guidelines. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Domain engineering aims at facilitating software development in an efficient and economical way. One way to measure that is through productivity indicators, which refer to the ability of creating a quality software product in a limited period and with limited resources. Many approaches have been devised to increase productivity; however, these approaches seem to suffer from a tension between expressiveness on the one hand, and applicability (or the lack of it) in providing guidance for developers. Objective This paper evaluates the applicability and efficiency of adopting a domain engineering approach, called Application-based {\{}DOmain{\}} Modeling (ADOM), in the context of the programming task with Java, and thus termed ADOM-Java, for improving productivity in terms of code quality and development time. Method To achieve that objective we have qualitatively evaluate the approach using questionnaires and following a text analysis procedure. We also set a controlled experiment in which 50 undergraduate students performed a Java-based programming task using either ADOM-Java or Java alone. Results The qualitative evaluation reveal that the approach is easy to uses and provides valuable guidance. Nevertheless, it requires training. The outcomes of the experiment indicate that the approach is applicable and that the students that used ADOM-Java achieved better code quality, as well as better functionality and within less time than the students who used only Java. Conclusion The results of the experiments imply that by providing a code base equipped with reuse guidelines for programmers can increase programming productivity in terms of quality and development time. These guidelines may also enforce coding standards and architectural design. },

However, due to time and space complexities, testing all products is not feasible, and SPL testing is proven to be difficult due to a combinatorial explosion of the number of products to be considered. Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) is suggested to reduce the size of test suites to overcome budget limitations and deadlines. CIT is conducted to fulfill certain quality attributes. This method can be further improvised through the prioritization of list configuration generated from CIT to gain better results in terms of efficiency and scalability, However, to the best of our knowledge, not much research has been done to evaluate existing Test Case Prioritization (TCP) techniques in SPL. This paper provides a survey of existing works on test case prioritization technique. This study provides classification and compares the best technique, trends, gaps and proposed frameworks based on the literature. The evaluation and discussion are using Normative Information Model-based Systems Analysis and Design (NIMSAD) on aspects that include context, content, and validation.

Validating these transformations is essential to ensure the quality and correctness of such models. However, MDE transformations become more complex to validate, for example, when they are implemented in different languages. One particular example is the transformation of the SyMPLES approach. SyMPLES is a development approach for embedded systems, which is based on concepts of both Software Product Lines (SPL) and MDE. SyMPLES has a model transformation process which creates Simulink models from SysML models. This paper presents a case study which applies test case generation based on SPL to validate this model transformation. An SPL was used to generate a set of test cases based on coverage criteria. The results showed that the test cases generated uncovered errors in the transformation of SyMPLES. In addition, a comparison with the test case generation based on metamodel is presented, in order to analyze the effectiveness of the techniques. The coverage criteria made it possible to reduce the number of test cases generated, thus minimizing test effort and time. {\textcopyright} 2018 Alexandre Augusto Giron, Itana Maria de Souza Gimenes and Edson OliveiraJr.},

  abstract = {Context Security in general, and database protection from unauthorized access in particular, are crucial for organizations. Although it has been long accepted that the important system requirements should be considered from the early stages of the development process, non-functional requirements such as security tend to get neglected or dealt with only at later stages of the development process. Objective We present an empirical study conducted to evaluate a Pattern-based method for Secure Development â PbSD â that aims to help developers, in particular database designers, to design database schemata that comply with the organizational security policies regarding authorization, from the early stages of development. The method provides a complete framework to guide, enforce and verify the correct implementation of security policies within a system design, and eventually generate a database schema from that design. Method The PbSD method was evaluated in comparison with a popular existing method that directly specifies the security requirements in {\{}SQL{\}} and Oracle's VPD. The two methods were compared with respect to the quality of the created access control specifications, the time it takes to complete the specification, and the perceived quality of the methods. Results We found that the quality of the access control specifications using the PbSD method for secure development were better with respect to privileges granted in the table, column and row granularity levels. Moreover, subjects who used the PbSD method completed the specification task in less time compared to subjects who used SQL. Finally, the subjects perceived the PbSD method clearer and more easy to use. Conclusion The pattern-based method for secure development can enhance the quality of security specification of databases, and decrease the software development time and cost. The results of the experiment may also indicate that the use of patterns in general has similar benefits; yet this requires further examinations. },

The feature specification task, performed in this phase, is usually based on natural language, which may lead to lack of clarity, non-conformities and defects. Consequently, scoping analysts may introduce ambiguity, inconsistency, omissions and non-conformities. In this sense, this paper aims at gathering evidence about the effects of applying an inspection approach to feature specification for SPL. Data from a SPL reengineering project were analyzed in this work and the analysis indicated that the correction activity demanded more effort. Also, Pareto's principle showed that incompleteness and ambiguity reported higher non-conformity occurrences. Finally, the Poisson regression analysis showed that sub-domain risk information can be a good indicator for prioritization of sub-domains in the inspection activity.{\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Software product line (SPL) scoping is an important phase when planning for product line adoption. An {\{}SPL{\}} scope specifies: (1) the extent of the domain supported by the product line, (2) portfolio of products in the product line and (3) list of assets to be developed for reuse across the family of products. Issue: {\{}SPL{\}} scope planning is usually based on estimates about the state of the market and the engineering capabilities of the development team. One challenge with these estimates is that there are inaccuracies due to uncertainty in the environment or accuracy of measurement. This may result in issues ranging from suboptimal plans to infeasible plans. Objective: To address the above, we propose to include uncertainty as part of the {\{}SPL{\}} scoping model. Plans developed in consideration of uncertainty would be more robust against possible fluctuations in estimates. Approach: In this paper, a method to incorporate uncertainty in scoping optimization and its application to generate robust solutions is proposed. We capture uncertainty as part of the formulation and model scoping optimization as a multi-objective problem with profit and stability as fitness functions. Profit stability and feasibility stability are considered to represent stability concerns. Results: Results show that, compared to other scope optimization approaches, both performance stability and feasibility stability are improved while maintaining near optimal performance for profit objective. Also, generated results consist of solutions with trade-offs between profit and stability, providing the decision maker with enhanced decision support. Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization with stability consideration for {\{}SPL{\}} scoping provides project managers with a robust and flexible way to address uncertainty in the process of {\{}SPL{\}} scoping. },

There is no single best product family approach that is suitable for all, since each product family has its unique context. Such a context comprises elements such as scope, organization, and business strategy. As these elements can change over time, the product family approach may have to evolve with them. In this paper we describe our ideas for a method to assess the variability approach of an existing product family, and to improve that approach to match the changing context. This is illustrated in a case study from the medical imaging domain. This product family in question started out with only a few family members, but over time, the growth in the number of different applications and new application domains have put higher variability demands on the family. These changes also require an evolution in the product family approach. We will describe the current product family approach and the changing requirements on this approach. We also performed a partially automated analysis of the variation to give us a good overview of the way variation is currently handled in the system. Based on that, a direction for evolving the product family approach is proposed. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

  abstract = {Diversity is prevalent in modern software systems. Several system variants exist at the same time in order to adapt to changing user requirements. Additionally, software systems evolve over time in order to adjust to unanticipated changes in their application environment. In modern software development, software architecture modeling is an important means to deal with system complexity by architectural decomposition. This leads to the need of architectural description languages that can represent spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, we present delta modeling of software architectures as a uniform modeling formalism for architectural variability in space and in time. In order to avoid degeneration of the product line model under system evolution, we present refactoring techniques to maintain and improve the quality of the variability model. Using a running example from the automotive domain, we evaluate our approach by carrying out a case study that compares delta modeling with annotative variability modeling. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {The increasing complexity and cost of software-intensive systems has led developers to seek ways of reusing software components across development projects. One approach to increasing software reusability is to develop a software product-line (SPL), which is a software architecture that can be reconfigured and reused across projects. Rather than developing software from scratch for a new project, a new configuration of the SPL is produced. It is hard, however, to find a configuration of an SPL that meets an arbitrary requirement set and does not violate any configuration constraints in the SPL. Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of an SPL in a single step. Budgetary constraints or other restrictions, however, may require multi-step configuration processes. For example, an aircraft manufacturer may want to produce a series of configurations of a plane over a span of years without exceeding a yearly budget to add features. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these SPL configuration problems can be automatically derived with a constraint solver by mapping them to CSPs. Moreover, we show how feature model changes can be mapped to our approach in a multi-step scenario by using feature model drift. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based reasoning technique can scale to SPL models with hundreds of features and multiple configuration steps. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Context âReuseâ and âModel Based Developmentâ are two prominent trends for improving industrial development efficiency. Product lines are used to reduce the time to create product variants by reusing components. The model based approach provides the opportunity to enhance knowledge capture for a system in the early stages in order to be reused throughout its lifecycle. This paper describes how these two trends are combined to support development and support of a simulator product line for the {\{}SAAB{\}} 39 Gripen fighter aircraft. Objective The work aims at improving the support (in terms of efficiency and quality) when creating simulation model configurations. Software based simulators are flexible so variants and versions of included models may easily be exchanged. The objective is to increase the reuse when combining models for usage in a range of development and training simulators. Method The research has been conducted with an interactive approach using prototyping and demonstrations, and the evaluation is based on an iterative and a retrospective method. Results A product line of simulator models for the {\{}SAAB{\}} 39 Gripen aircraft has been analyzed and defined in a Product Variant Master. A configurator system has been implemented for creation, integration, and customization of stringent simulator model configurations. The system is currently under incorporation in the standard development process at {\{}SAAB{\}} Aeronautics. Conclusion The explicit and visual description of products and their variability through a configurator system enables better insights and a common understanding so that collaboration on possible product configurations improves and the potential of software reuse increases. The combination of application fields imposes constraints on how traditional tools and methods may be utilized. Solutions for Design Automation and Knowledge Based Engineering are available, but their application has limitations for Software Product Line engineering and the reuse of simulation models. },

This work identifies decision lead time and outcome factors in large-scale requirements engineering. Our investigation brings supporting evidence that complex changes have longer lead time and that important customers more likely get what they request. The results provide input into the discussion of whether a large company should focus on only a few of its large customers and disregard its significantly larger group of small customers.
Lead time, defined as the duration between the moment a request was filed and the moment the decision was made, is an important aspect of decision making in market-driven requirements engineering. Minimizing lead time allows software companies to focus their resources on the most profitable functionality and enables them to remain competitive within the quickly changing software market. Achieving and sustaining low decision lead time and the resulting high decision efficiency require a better understanding of factors that may affect both decision lead time and outcome. In order to identify possible factors, we conducted an exploratory two-stage case study that combines the statistical analysis of seven possible relationships among decision characteristics at a large company with a survey of industry participants. Our results show that the number of products affected by a decision increases the time needed to make a decision. Practitioners should take this aspect into consideration when planning for efficient decision making and possibly reducing the complexity of decisions. Our results also show that when a change request originates from an important customer, the request is more often accepted. The results provide input into the discussion of whether a large company should focus on only a few of its large customers and disregard its significantly larger group of small customers. The results provide valuable insights for researchers, who can use them to plan research of decision-making processes and methods, and for practitioners, who can use them to optimize their decision-making processes. In future work, we plan to investigate other decision characteristics, such as the number of stakeholders involved in the discussion about the potential change or the number of dependencies between software components. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

One way to evaluate the feature model is to use measures that could be associated with the feature model quality characteristics and their quality attributes. In this paper, we aim at investigating how measures can be applied to the quality assessment of SPL feature models. We performed an exploratory case study using the COfFEE maintainability measures catalog and the S.P.L.O.T. feature models repository. In order to support this case study, we built a dataset (denoted by MAcchiATO) containing the values of 32 measures from COfFEE for 218 software feature models, extracted from S.P.L.O.T. This research approach allowed us to explore three different data analysis techniques. First, we applied the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in order to identify relationships between the measures. This analysis showed that not all 32 measures in COfFEE are necessary to reveal the quality of a feature model and just 15 measures could be used. Next, the 32 measures in COfFEE were grouped by applying the Principal Component Analysis and a set of 9 new grouped measures were defined. Finally, we used the Tolerance Interval technique to define statistical thresholds for these 9 new grouped measures. So, our findings suggest that measures can be effectively used to support the quality evaluation of SPL feature models.},

  abstract = {Feature Algebra was introduced as an abstract framework for feature-oriented software development. One goal is to provide a common, clearly defined basis for the key ideas of feature-orientation. The algebra captures major aspects of feature-orientation, such as the hierarchical structure of features and feature composition. However, as we will show, it is not able to model aspects at the level of code, i.e., situations where code fragments of different features have to be merged. In other words, it does not reflect details of concrete implementations. In this paper we first present concrete models for the original axioms of Feature Algebra which represent the main concepts of feature-oriented programs. This shows that the abstract Feature Algebra can be interpreted in different ways. We then use these models to show that the axioms of Feature Algebra do not properly reflect all aspects of feature-orientation from the level of directory structures down to the level of actual code. This gives motivation to extend the abstract algebra, which is the second main contribution of the paper. We modify the axioms and introduce the concept of an Extended Feature Algebra. As third contribution, we introduce more operators to cover concepts like overriding in the abstract setting.},

  abstract = {Software product management is generally expected to link and integrate business and product related goals with core software engineering and software life cycle activities. Empirical research demonstrates the positive effect of mature software product management practices on key software development performance indicators. Nevertheless, the various frameworks available for software product management have distinct and diverse focus points, are often linked or incorporated with specific development paradigms, or lack integration with or addressing of core software engineering activities. On the other hand, traditional software process improvement approaches generally lack the provision of explicit or detailed software product management activities. - In this paper we build on the results of preceding research on identifying a lack of software product management practices within ISO/IEC 12207 and on deriving key outcomes of software product management activities from selected software product management frameworks. Based on these results we propose a process reference model for software product management that can be integrated with the process reference model as defined in ISO/IEC 12207 for software life cycle processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Sets of common features are essential assets to be reused in fulfilling specific needs in software product line methodology. In Requirements Reuse (RR), the extraction of software features from Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) is viable only to practitioners who have access to these software artefacts. Due to organisational privacy, SRS are always kept confidential and not easily available to the public. As alternatives, researchers opted to use the publicly available software descriptions such as product brochures and online software descriptions to identify potential software features to initiate the RR process. The aim of this paper is to propose a semi-automated approach, known as Feature Extraction for Reuse of Natural Language requirements (FENL), to extract phrases that can represent software features from software reviews in the absence of SRS as a way to initiate the RR process. FENL is composed of four stages, which depend on keyword occurrences from several combinations of nouns, verbs, and/or adjectives. In the experiment conducted, phrases that could reflect software features, which reside within online software reviews were extracted by utilising the techniques from information retrieval (IR) area. As a way to demonstrate the feature groupings phase, a semi-automated approach to group the extracted features were then conducted with the assistance of a modified word overlap algorithm. As for the evaluation, the proposed extraction approach is evaluated through experiments against the truth data set created manually. The performance results obtained from the feature extraction phase indicates that the proposed approach performed comparably with related works in terms of recall, precision, and F-Measure. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Abstract i* models are inherently sequence agnostic. This makes the process of cross-checking i* models against temporal properties quite impossible. There is an immediate industrial need to bridge the gap between such a sequence agnostic model and a standardized model verifier so that model checking can be performed in the requirement analysis phase itself. In this paper, we first spell out the Naive Algorithm that generates all possible finite state models corresponding to a given i* model. The growth of the finite state model space can be mapped to the problem of finding the number of possible paths between the Least Upper Bound (LUB) and the Greatest Lower Bound (GLB) of a k-dimensional hypercube lattice structure. The mathematics for doing a quantitative analysis of the space growth has also been presented. The Naive Algorithm has its main drawback in the hyperexponential growth of the model space. The Semantic Implosion Algorithm is proposed as a solution to the hyperexponential problem. This algorithm exploits the temporal information embedded within the i* model of an enterprise to reduce the rate of growth of the finite state model space. A comparative quantitative analysis between the two approaches concludes the superiority of the Semantic Implosion Algorithm. },

  abstract = {Abstract When developing domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs), software engineers have to make a number of important design decisions on the {\{}DSML{\}} itself, or on the software-development process that is applied to develop the DSML. Thus, making well-informed design decisions is a critical factor in developing DSMLs. To support this decision-making process, the model-driven development community has started to collect established design practices in terms of patterns, guidelines, story-telling, and procedural models. However, most of these documentation practices do not capture the details necessary to reuse the rationale behind these decisions in other {\{}DSML{\}} projects. In this paper, we report on a three-year research effort to compile and to empirically validate a catalog of structured decision descriptions (decision records) for UML-based DSMLs. This catalog is based on design decisions extracted from 90 {\{}DSML{\}} projects. These projects were identifiedâamong othersâvia an extensive systematic literature review (SLR) for the years 2005â2012. Based on more than 8,000 candidate publications, we finally selected 84 publications for extracting design-decision data. The extracted data were evaluated quantitatively using a frequent-item-set analysis to obtain characteristic combinations of design decisions and qualitatively to document recurring documentation issues for UML-based DSMLs. We revised the collected decision records based on this evidence and made the decision-record catalog for developing UML-based {\{}DSMLs{\}} publicly available. Furthermore, our study offers insights into {\{}UML{\}} usage (e.g. diagram types) and into the adoption of {\{}UML{\}} extension techniques (e.g. metamodel extensions, profiles). },

That is, a single feature might require various implementations for different customers. Also, features might need optional extensions that are needed by some but not all products. Software product line engineering manages variability by conducting a thorough domain analysis upfront during the planning phases. However, upfront, heavyweight planning approaches are not well-aligned with the values of minimalistic practices like XP where bottom-up, incremental development is common. In this paper, we introduce a bottom-up, test-driven approach to introduce variability to systems by reactively refactoring existing code. We support our approach with an eclipse plug-in to automate the refactoring process. We evaluate our approach by a case study to determine the feasibility and practicality of the approach. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

Accurate failure predictions can help in mitigating the impact of failures. Resources, applications, and services can be scheduled to limit the impact of failures. However, providing accurate predictions sufficiently ahead is challenging. Log files contain messages that represent a change of system state. A sequence or a pattern of messages may be used to predict failures. Contribution We describe an approach to predict failures based on log files using Random Indexing (RI) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Method {\{}RI{\}} is applied to represent sequences: each operation is characterized in terms of its context. {\{}SVMs{\}} associate sequences to a class of failures or non-failures. Weighted {\{}SVMs{\}} are applied to deal with imbalanced datasets and to improve the true positive rate. We apply our approach to log files collected during approximately three months of work in a large European manufacturing company. Results According to our results, weighted {\{}SVMs{\}} sacrifice some specificity to improve sensitivity. Specificity remains higher than 0.80 in four out of six analyzed applications. Conclusions Overall, our approach is very reliable in predicting both failures and non-failures. },

However, mobile users are still experiencing poor service quality on the move due to the large handoff delay and packet loss problem. In order to reduce the delay, a new handoff scheme using the geomagnetic sensor embedded in mobile devices is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme predicts the movement direction of a Mobile Station (MS) from the currently associated Access Point (AP) and performs active scanning with a reduced number of channels. In terms of the packet loss, a lightweight retransmission protocol is also proposed to minimize lost packets on Wi-Fi without producing a lot of acknowledgement packets. The proposed approaches are implemented on Android smartphones, and their performance is evaluated in a real indoor {\{}WLAN{\}} environment. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes maintain seamless quality for real-time video even in an environment with frequent handoffs. Note that the proposed schemes are a client-only solution and do not require modification of the existing APs, which renders them very practical. },

Ideally, system instances are rapidly assembled by combining features desired by the particular customer. Unfortunately, features often interact, meaning their combination causes unintended undesirable behavior even though in isolation the features work fine. This paper describes an approach to feature combination and interaction detection via foreground/background models, which allows expressing features as augmentations to the behavior of a base model. It also classifies interactions into three categories, based on how they can be detected, and describes implemented tools which can detect interactions from the three categories. I show why this approach avoids falsely detecting the spurious Type I interactions to which many existing approaches are prone. The tools and methodology, as well as the prevalence of spurious interactions in existing approaches, are illustrated through application to telephony features from the feature interaction contest associated with FIW'98. This data provides evidence that the foreground/background approach catches more nonspurious interactions, with less human effort, than competing approaches. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext A Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of software systems that share common functionalities, so-called features. When features are related, we consider this relation a feature dependency. Whenever a new feature is added, the presence of feature dependencies in the source code may increase the maintenance effort. In particular, along the maintenance of {\{}SPL{\}} implementation, added features may induce changes in other features, the so-called change propagation. Change propagation is the set of ripple changes required to other features whenever a particular feature is added or changed. Objective The relationship between feature dependency and change propagation is not well understood. Therefore, the objective of our study is to examine the relation between feature dependency and change propagation. Method We investigate change propagation through feature dependencies in additive changes on five evolving SPLs. We analysed a wide range of additive changes in 21 representations of those SPLs. This analysis enabled us to understand whether and how features dependencies and change propagations are related. Results The results have empirically confirmed for the first time the strong relation between feature dependency and change propagation. We also identified what are the circumstances involving dependent features that are more likely to cause change propagation. Surprisingly, the results also suggested that the extent of change propagation across {\{}SPL{\}} features might be higher than the one found in previous studies of dependent modules in non-SPLs. We also found a concentration of change propagation in a few feature dependencies. Conclusion Even though the results show that there is a strong relation between feature dependencies and change propagation, such relation is not alike for all dependencies. This indicates that (i) a general feature dependency minimisation might not ameliorate the change propagation, and (ii) feature dependency properties must be analysed beforehand to drive maintenance effort to important dependencies. },

  abstract = {Abstract Requirements for implemented system can be extracted and reused for a production of a new similar system. Extraction of common and variable features from requirements leverages the benefits of the software product lines engineering (SPLE). Although various approaches have been proposed in feature extractions from natural language (NL) requirements, no related literature review has been published to date for this topic. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of the state-of-the-art approaches in feature extractions from {\{}NL{\}} requirements for reuse in SPLE. We have included 13 studies in our synthesis of evidence and the results showed that hybrid natural language processing approaches were found to be in common for overall feature extraction process. A mixture of automated and semi-automated feature clustering approaches from data mining and information retrieval were also used to group common features, with only some approaches coming with support tools. However, most of the support tools proposed in the selected studies were not made available publicly and thus making it hard for practitioners' adoption. As for the evaluation, this {\{}SLR{\}} reveals that not all studies employed software metrics as ways to validate experiments and case studies. Finally, the quality assessment conducted confirms that practitioners' guidelines were absent in the selected studies. },

  abstract = {In Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), many feature modeling approaches of Service Provider (SP) have been proposed, notably: the two widely used service contracts WSDL and WADL. By studying these approaches, we found that they suffer from several problems, notably: they only work for specific communication technologies (e.g., SOAP or REST) and they do not explicitly model SOA Design Pattern (DPs) and their compounds. One major benefit of using a DP or a compound DP is to develop SPs with proven design solutions. In this paper, in order to overcome these problems, we propose an approach that integrates Software Product Line (SPL) techniques in the development of SPs. Essentially, we propose a Feature Model (FM), which is the defacto standard for variability modeling in SPL, for the feature modeling of SP. This FM, named FMSP, is designed as a DP-based service contract for SP that models different features including 16 SOA DPs and their compounds that are related to the service messaging category. Its objective to enable developers to generate fully functional, valid, DP-based and highly customized SPs for different communication technologies. Through a practical case study and a developed tool, we validate our FMSP and demonstrate that it reduces the development costs (effort and time) of SPs. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

  volume   = {94},
  pages    = {59--81},
  abstract = {Context Verification techniques are being applied to ensure that software systems achieve desired quality levels and fulfill functional and non-functional requirements. However, applying these techniques to software product lines is challenging, given the exponential blowup of the number of products. Current product-line verification techniques leverage symbolic model checking and variability information to optimize the analysis, but still face limitations that make them costly or infeasible. In particular, state-of-the-art verification techniques for product-line reliability analysis are enumerative which hinders their applicability, given the latent exponential blowup of the configuration space. Objective The objectives of this paper are the following: (a) we present a method to efficiently compute the reliability of all configurations of a compositional or annotation-based software product line from its UML behavioral models, (b) we provide a tool that implements the proposed method, and (c) we report on an empirical study comparing the performance of different reliability analysis strategies for software product lines. Method We present a novel feature-family-based analysis strategy to compute the reliability of all products of a (compositional or annotation-based) software product line. The feature-based step of our strategy divides the behavioral models into smaller units that can be analyzed more efficiently. The family-based step performs the reliability computation for all configurations at once by evaluating reliability expressions in terms of a suitable variational data structure. Results Our empirical results show that our feature-family-based strategy for reliability analysis outperforms, in terms of time and space, four state-of-the-art strategies (product-based, family-based, feature-product-based, and family-product-based) for the same property. It is the only one that could be scaled to a 220-fold increase in the size of the configuration space. Conclusion Our feature-family-based strategy leverages both feature- and family-based strategies by taming the size of the models to be analyzed and by avoiding the products enumeration inherent to some state-of-the-art analysis methods. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigate whether feature-based specifications can be used for this task. Feature-based specifications are a special class of specifications that aim at modularity in open-world, feature-oriented systems. The question we address is whether modularity of specifications impairs the ability to detect feature interactions, which cut across feature boundaries. In an exploratory study on 10 feature-oriented systems, we found that the majority of feature interactions could be detected based on feature-based specifications, but some specifications have not been modularized properly and require undesirable workarounds to modularization. Based on the study, we discuss the merits and limitations of feature-based specifications, as well as open issues and perspectives. A goal that underlies our work is to raise awareness of the importance and challenges of feature-based specification. },

  abstract      = {Home service robots have a wide range of potential applications, such as home security, patient caring, cleaning, etc. The services provided by the robots in each application area are being defined as markets are formed and, therefore, they change constantly. Thus, robot applications need to evolve both quickly and flexibly adopting frequently changing requirements. This makes software product line framework ideal for the domain of home service robots. Unfortunately, however, robot manufacturers often focus on developing technical components (e.g., vision recognizer and speech processor) and then attempt to develop robots by integrating these components in an ad-hoc way. This practice produces robot applications that are hard to re-use and evolve when requirements change. We believe that re-engineering legacy robot applications into product line assets can significantly enhance reusability and evolvability. In this paper, we present our experience of re-engineering legacy home service robot applications into product line assets through feature modeling and analysis. First, through reverse engineering, we recovered architectures and components of the legacy applications. Second, based on the recovered information and domain knowledge, we reconstructed a feature model for the legacy applications. Anticipating changes in business opportunities or technologies, we restructured and refined the feature model to produce a feature model for the product line. Finally, based on the refined feature model and engineering principles we adopted for asset development, we designed a new architecture and components for robot applications. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

The tool provides integrated support for domain and application engineering, offering an iterative and incremental style of development. In this paper, we apply SuperMod to a well-known case study, the Home Automation System product line.

However, resource monitoring does not come for free as it typically leads to overhead in the observed program. Minimizing this overhead and increasing the reliability of the monitored data is a major goal in realizing resource monitoring tools. Typically, this is achieved by limiting capabilities, e.g., supported resources, granularity of the monitoring focus, or runtime access to results. Thus, in practice often several approaches must be combined to obtain relevant information. We describe SPASS-meter, a novel resource monitoring approach for Java and Android Apps, which combines these conflicting capabilities with low overhead. SPASS-meter supports a large set of resources, flexible configuration of the monitoring scope even for user-defined semantic units (components), runtime analysis and online access to monitoring results in a platform-independent way. We discuss the concepts of SPASS-meter, its architecture, realization and validation, the latter in terms of case studies and an overhead analysis based on performance experiments with SPASS-meter, OpenCore and Kieker. SPASS-meter provides a detailed view of the runtime resource consumption at reasonable overhead of less than 3{\%} processing power and 0.5{\%} memory consumption in our experiments. },

  abstract = {Abstract Process flexibility and adaptability is a frequently discussed topic in literature, and several approaches propose techniques to improve and optimize software processes for a given organization- or project context. A software process line (SPrL) is an instrument to systematically construct and manage variable software processes, by combining pre-defined and standardized process assets that can be reused, modified, and extended using a well-defined customization approach. Hence, process engineers can ground context-specific process variants in a standardized or domain-specific reference model that can be adapted to the respective context. In this article, we present an approach to construct flexible software process lines and show its practical application in the German V-ModellÂ XT. The presented approach emerges from a 10-year research endeavor and was used to enhance the metamodel of the V-ModellÂ XT and to allow for improved process variability and lifecycle management. Practical dissemination and complementing empirical research show the suitability of the concept. We therefore contribute a proven approach that is presented as metamodel fragment for reuse and implementation in further process modeling approaches. },

  abstract = {Purpose-This paper aims to discuss the motivation and present the evolution from a Software Product Line (SPL) in the e-Gov Web (e-Gov Web SPL) domain to a SPL in the mobile domain (e-Gov Mobile SPL). Design/methodology/approach-The evolution was supported by the Product Line UML-Based Software Engineering approach and the feature model. Findings-The authors were able to observe that it is feasible to evolve from a SPL for the Web platform to a SPL for the mobile platform, with the intent to port existing Web applications to mobile platforms such that users can have access to the main information and are able to interact with the most important functionalities of Web applications in a mobile device. Research limitations/implications-As for the main limitations, the authors can point out the small number of instantiations performed until the moment with the support of the e-Gov Mobile SPL, what prevented the conduction of an empirical study. Practical implications-Using e-Gov Mobile SPL, it is possible to reduce development time and cost. Originality/value-The existing SPLs do not worry about supporting the development of mobile applications corresponding to existing Web applications, as it is desirable to have access to the information and main features of these applications in mobile devices. We obtained some e-Gov Mobile SPL instantiations corresponding to e-Gov Web SPL instantiations to attend the demands of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation Unit situated at Campo Grande, MS, Brazil. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Although several approaches reported in the literature address this issue, complex cross-tree relationships involving attributes in extended feature models have not been handled. In this article, we introduce a mapping from extended feature models to constraint logic programming over finite domains. This mapping is used to translate into constraint logic programs; basic, cardinality-based and extended feature models, which can include complex cross-tree relationships involving attributes. This translation enables the use of off-the-shelf constraint solvers for the automated analysis of extended feature models involving such complex relationships. We also present the performance results of some well-known analysis operations on an example translated model. },

Teleo-Reactive programs are written in a manner that allows engineers to define the behaviour of the system while taking into account goals and changes in the state of the environment. This article presents a systematic approach that makes it possible to derive architectural models, with structural descriptions and behaviour, from Teleo-Reactive Programs. The development of reactive systems can therefore benefit significantly from a combination of two approaches: (1) the Teleo-Reactive approach, which is oriented towards a description of the system from the standpoint of the goals identified and the state of the environment and (2) the architectural approach, which is oriented towards the design of component-based software, in which decisions are conditioned by the need to reuse already tested solutions. The integration of this work into a development environment that allows code to be generated via model transformations opens up new possibilities in the development of this type of systems. The proposal is validated through a case study that is representative of the domain, and a survey carried out with post-graduate students. },

This led to the creation of different and unrelated approaches to handle specific attributes, such as security, performance, adaptability, etc. The challenge is to propose a flexible approach that could be configured to address multiple attributes of interest, promoting the reuse of best practices and reduction of development costs. We advocate the use of Software Product Line (SPL) principles to manage and customize variability in software processes targeted for the generation of architectural models from requirements models. Hence, in this paper we propose F-STREAM, a flexible and systematic process to derive architecture models from requirements. We define a common core process, its variation and extension points. The definition of this process was performed based on a survey of the existing approaches. As example, we instantiate a process for adaptive systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Abstract Teaching strategies have been proven to influence the academic performance of students, as well as group sociometrics have been proven to be directly related to group performance. Although in the literature there are examples of teaching strategies and the resulting sociograms, there is not any detailed technique, tool or simulator that predicts the influence of a new teaching strategy on group sociometrics. The current work is aimed at covering this gap in the literature, by providing a framework for programming teaching strategies to simulate their influence on group sociometrics. In particular, this framework is called FTS-SOCI (Framework for simulating Teaching Strategies with evolutions of SOCIograms). This framework includes an agent-based simulator that simulates the evolution of sociograms taking five models of the literature into account. In this framework, students and teacher are modelled as agents, and the teacher agent can have any teaching strategy defined by the user. In order to test the current approach, this work simulates existing teaching strategies in (1) nursing education and (2) sport lessons. The resulting sociograms of FTS-SOCI for these strategies have been compared with the corresponding real sociograms reported in the literature. This works shows that the group sociometric values provided by FTS-SOCI are quite similar to the real cases. For instance, the mean squared error of the group cohesion sociometric (i.e. {\{}IAg{\}} metric) is only 0.00024 and 0.00068 respectively for the teaching strategies of both fields. },

The use of Frameworks and Components has proven effective in improving productivity and software quality, especially when combined with Software Product Line approaches. However, the results in terms of software reuse and standardization make the lack of portability of both the design and componentbased implementations clear. This article, based on the Model- Driven Software Development paradigm, presents an approach that separates the component-based description of real-time applications from their possible implementations on different platforms. This separation is supported by the automatic integration of the code obtained from the input models into object-oriented frameworks. The article also details the architectural decisions taken in the implementation of one of such frameworks, which is used as a case study to illustrate the proposed approach. Finally, a comparison with other alternative approaches is made in terms of development cost.},

We attempt to realise this vision by building blogs out of product catalogues. Unfortunately, the immaturity of blog engines makes this endeavour risky. This paper presents a model-driven approach to face this drawback. This implies the introduction of (meta)models: the catalogue model, based on the standard Open Catalog Format, and blog models, that elaborate on the use of blogs as conduits for virtual communities. Blog models end up being realised through blog engines. Specifically, we focus on two types of engines: a hosted blog platform and a standalone blog platform, both in Blojsom. However, the lack of standards in a broad and constantly evolving blog-engine space, hinders both the portability and the maintainability of the solution. Hence, we resort to the notion of âabstract platformâ as a way to depart from the peculiarities of specific blog engines. Additionally, the paper measures the reuse gains brought by {\{}MDE{\}} in comparison with the manual coding of blogs. },

  abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are an approach to reuse in-the-large that models a set of closely related software systems in terms of commonalities and variabilities. Design patterns are best practices for addressing recurring design problems in object-oriented source code. In the practice of implementing SPL, instances of certain design patterns are employed to handle variability, which makes these âvariability-aware design patternsâ a best practice for SPL design. However, currently there is no dedicated method for proactively developing SPLs using design patterns suitable for realizing variable functionality. In this paper, we present a method to perform generative SPL development with design patterns. We use role models to capture design patterns and their relation to a variability model. We further allow mapping of individual design pattern roles to (parts of) implementation elements to be generated (e.g., classes, methods) and check the conformance of the realization with the specification of the pattern. We provide definitions for the variability-aware versions of the design patterns Observer, Strategy, Template Method and Composite. Furthermore, we support generation of realizations in Java, C++ and UML class diagrams utilizing annotative, compositional and transformational variability realization mechanisms. Hence, we support proactive development of SPLs using design patterns to apply best practices for the realization of variability. We realize our concepts within the Eclipse IDE and demonstrate them within a case study. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Feature Diagrams (FDs) are a family of popular modelling languages used to address the feature interaction problem, particularly in software product lines, FDs were first introduced by Kang as part of the FODA (Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis) method back in 1990. Afterwards, various extensions of FODA FDs were introduced to compensate for a purported ambiguity and lack of precision and expressiveness. However, they never received a formal semantics, which is the hallmark of precision and unambiguity and a prerequisite for efficient and safe tool automation. The reported work is intended to contribute a more rigorous approach to the definition, understanding, evaluation, selection and implementation of FD languages. First, we provide a survey of FD variants. Then, we give them a formal semantics, thanks to a generic construction that we call Free Feature Diagrams (FFDs). This demonstrates that FDs can be precise and unambiguous. This also defines their expressiveness. Many variants are expressively complete, and thus the endless quest for extensions actually cannot be justified by expressiveness. A finer notion is thus needed to compare these expressively complete languages. Two solutions are well-established: succinctness and embeddability, that express the naturalness of a language. We show that the expressively complete FDs fall into two succinctness classes, of which we of course recommend the most succinct. Among the succinct expressively complete languages, we suggest a new, simple one that is not harmfully redundant: Varied FD (VFD). Finally, we study the execution time that tools will need to solve useful problems in these languages. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Identifying and representing domain requirements among products in a product family are crucial activities for a successful software reuse. The domain requirements should be not only identified based on the business goal, which drives marketing plan, product plan, and differences among products, but also represented as familiar notations in order to support developing a particular product in the product family. Thus, our proposal is to identify the domain requirements through goals and scenarios, and represent them as variable use cases for a product family. Especially, for identification of the domain requirements, we propose four abstraction levels of requirements in a product family, and goal and scenario modeling. For representation of them, variable use case model is suggested, and also the use case transfer rules are proposed so as to bridge the gap between the identification and representation activity. The paper illustrates the application of the approach within a supporting tool using the {\{}HIS{\}} (Home Integration System) example. },

  abstract = {Goal models represent requirements and intentions of a software system. They play an important role in the development life cycle of software product lines (SPLs). In the domain engineering phase, goal models guide the development of variability in SPLs by providing the rationale for the variability, while they are used for the configuration of SPLs in the application engineering phase. However, variability in SPLs, which is represented by feature models, usually has design and implementation-induced constraints. When those constraints are not aligned with variability in goal models, the configuration with goal models becomes error prone. To remedy this problem, we propose a description logic (DL)-based approach to represent both models and their relations in a common DL knowledge base. Moreover, we apply reasoning to detect inconsistencies in the variability of goal and feature models. A formal proof is provided to demonstrate the correctness of the reasoning approach. An empirical evaluation shows computational tractability of the inconsistency detection. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {AbstractContext Combinatorial testing strategies have lately received a lot of attention as a result of their diverse applications. In its simple form, a combinatorial strategy can reduce several input parameters (configurations) of a system into a small set based on their interaction (or combination). In practice, the input configurations of software systems are subjected to constraints, especially in case of highly configurable systems. To implement this feature within a strategy, many difficulties arise for construction. While there are many combinatorial interaction testing strategies nowadays, few of them support constraints. Objective This paper presents a new strategy, to construct combinatorial interaction test suites in the presence of constraints. Method The design and algorithms are provided in detail. To overcome the multi-judgement criteria for an optimal solution, the multi-objective particle swarm optimisation and multithreading are used. The strategy and its associated algorithms are evaluated extensively using different benchmarks and comparisons. Results Our results are promising as the evaluation results showed the efficiency and performance of each algorithm in the strategy. The benchmarking results also showed that the strategy can generate constrained test suites efficiently as compared to state-of-the-art strategies. Conclusion The proposed strategy can form a new way for constructing of constrained combinatorial interaction test suites. The strategy can form a new and effective base for future implementations. },

However, various architectural design views still provide the most common means for describing and communicating architectural design. The evolution of software systems requires that both {\{}ADDs{\}} and architectural design views are documented and maintained, which is a tedious and time-consuming task in the long run. Also, in lack of a systematic and automated support for bridging between {\{}ADDs{\}} and architectural design views, decisions and designs tend to become inconsistent over time. In our proposal, we introduce a reusable {\{}AK{\}} transformation language for supporting the automated transformation of reusable {\{}AK{\}} knowledge to component-and-connector models, the architectural design view used most commonly today. In addition, reusable consistency checking rules verify the consistency between decisions and designs. We evaluate our approach in an industrial case study and show that it offers high reusability, provides automation, and can, in principle, deal with large numbers of recurring decisions. },

SPL engineering is a paradigm to develop software applications that commonly use a feature model to capture and document common and variable features, and their relationships. A big challenge is to derive one product among all possible products in the SPL, which satisfies the business and customer requirements. This task is known as product configuration. Although product configuration has been extensively investigated in the literature, customer's preferences are frequently neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to configure a product that considers both qualitative and quantitative feature properties. We model the product configuration task as a combinatorial optimization problem, and heuristic and exact algorithms are proposed. As far as we are concerned, this proposal is the first work in the literature that considers feature properties in both leaf and nonleaf features. Computational experiments showed that the best of our heuristics found optimal solutions for all instances where those are known. For the instances where optimal solutions are not known, our heuristic outperformed the best solution obtained by a one-hour run of the exact algorithm by up to 67.89{\%}.},

However, it is still not clear how harmful they are perceived from the developers' point of view. Many developers talk about them, but only few know what they really are, and even fewer really take care of them in their source code. Objective. The goal of this work is to understand the perceived criticality of code smells both in theory, when reading their description, and in practice. Method. We executed an empirical study as a differentiated external replication of two previous studies. The studies were conducted as surveys involving only highly experienced developers (63 in the first study and 41 in the second one). First the perceived criticality was analyzed by proposing the description of the smells, then different pieces of code infected by the smells were proposed, and finally their ability to identify the smells in the analyzed code was tested. Results. According to our knowledge, this is the largest study so far investigating the perception of code smells with professional software developers. The results show that developers are very concerned about code smells in theory, nearly always considering them as harmful or very harmful (17 out of 23 smells). However, when they were asked to analyze an infected piece of code, only few infected classes were considered harmful and even fewer were considered harmful because of the smell. Conclusions. The results confirm our initial hypotheses that code smells are perceived as more critical in theory but not as critical in practice.},

  abstract = {AbstractContext It has become common practice to build programs by using libraries. While the benefits of reuse are well known, an often overlooked risk are system runtime failures due to {\{}API{\}} changes in libraries that evolve independently. Traditionally, the consistency between a program and the libraries it uses is checked at build time when the entire system is compiled and tested. However, the trend towards partially upgrading systems by redeploying only evolved library versions results in situations where these crucial verification steps are skipped. For Java programs, partial upgrades create additional interesting problems as the compiler and the virtual machine use different rule sets to enforce contracts between the providers and the consumers of APIs. Objective We have studied the extent of the problem in real world programs. We were interested in two aspects: the compatibility of {\{}API{\}} changes as libraries evolve, and the impact this has on programs using these libraries. Method This study is based on the qualitas corpus version 20120401. A data set consisting of 109 Java open-source programs and 564 program versions was used from this corpus. We have investigated two types of library dependencies: explicit dependencies to embedded libraries, and dependencies defined by symbolic references in Maven build files that are resolved at build time. We have used JaCC for {\{}API{\}} analysis, this tool is based on the popular {\{}ASM{\}} byte code analysis library. Results We found that for most of the programs we investigated, {\{}APIs{\}} are unstable as incompatible changes are common. Surprisingly, there are more compatibility problems in projects that use automated dependency resolution. However, we found only a few cases where this has an actual impact on other programs using such an API. Conclusion It is concluded that {\{}API{\}} instability is common and causes problems for programs using these APIs. Therefore, better tools and methods are needed to safeguard library evolution. },

  abstract = {Software configuration, which aims to customize the software for different users (e.g., Linux kernel configuration), is an important and complicated task. In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature oriented domain analysis is adopted and feature model is used to guide the configuration of new product variants. In SPLE, product configuration is an optimal feature selection problem, which needs to find a set of features that have no conflicts and meanwhile achieve multiple design objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing the number of features). In previous studies, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used for the optimal feature selection problem and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) was proven to be the best MOEA for this problem. However, IBEA still suffers from the issues of correctness and diversity of found solutions. In this paper, we propose a dual-population evolutionary algorithm, named IBED, to achieve both correctness and diversity of solutions. In IBED, two populations are individually evolved with two different types of evolutionary operators, i.e., IBEA operators and differential evolution (DE) operators. Furthermore, we propose two enhancement techniques for existing MOEAs, namely the feedback-directed mechanism to fast find the correct solutions (e.g., solutions that satisfy the feature model constraints) and the preprocessing method to reduce the search space. Our empirical results have shown that IBED with the enhancement techniques can outperform several state-of-the-art MOEAs on most case studies in terms of correctness and diversity of found solutions. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Abstract A requirements reuse setups typically includes reusable requirement set(s) containing a collection of reusable requirements and a number of product specific requirements sets which are drawn from the reusable set(s). The ideal scenario when reusing requirements is that all the product requirements can be drawn directly from the reusable set. However, this is rarely the case in product development as new requirements are likely to surface. A critical issue in requirements reuse therefore becomes how to enable products to efficiently reuse requirements as well incorporating changes to the product set. In this paper the objective is not to present a specific method for requirements reuse but to introduce and discuss the possible dimensions of adjustability when generating a product requirement set by reusing requirements from a reusable set. Six adjustability dimensions have been identified. An extensive state of the art is included to introduce the presented methods related to each adjustability dimensions. The options for implementing each adjustability dimensions in a requirement reuse approach are illustrated along with a discussion regarding the benefits and issues resulting from each option. This discussion should help practitioners to better understand the possible methods that can be implemented and to design a user friendly and sustainable approach. A case study, describing how the dimensions are incorporated in two requirements reuse approaches, for Danfoss Solar Inverters (SI) and Danfoss Frequency Drives is provided. As a result an overview of how each adjustability dimensions is implemented in each case is presented. The case study demonstrates that all the identified adjustability dimensions were important elements in requirements reuse implementation. The case study furthermore highlights the need, not only to understand the effects of each adjustability dimension but also of the dependencies to case specific criterions. The classification of adjustability dimensions in requirements reuse and the options for their implementation has not been outlined by previous research and should be a useful contribution both to researchers and practitioners working in the field of requirements reuse. },

Companies often create variants of their existing software by copying and modifying them to changed requirements. While these so-called clone-and-own approaches allow to save money in short-term, they expose the company to severe risks regarding long-term evolution and product quality. The main reason is the high manual maintenance effort which is needed due to the unknown relations between variants. In this paper, we introduce a modelbased approach to identify variability information for OOP code, allowing companies to better understand and manage variability between their variants. This information allows to improve maintenance of the variants and to transition from single variant development to more elaborate reuse strategies such as software product lines. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by means of a case study analyzing variants generated from an existing software product line and comparing our findings to the managed reuse strategy. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

In many countries, public service organizations have the legal obligation to develop and maintain emergency plans covering all possible hazards relative to their areas of operation. However, little support is provided to planners in the development and use of plans. Often, advances in software technology have not been exploited, and plans remain as text documents whose accessibility is very limited. In this paper, we advocate for the definition and implementation of plan management processes as the first step to better produce and manage emergency plans. The main contribution of our work is to raise the need for IT-enabled planning environments, either at the national or organization-specific levels, which can lead to more uniform plans that are easier to evaluate and share, with support to stakeholders other than responders, among other advantages. To illustrate our proposal, we introduce SAGA, a framework that supports the full lifecycle of emergency plan management. SAGA provides all the actors involved in plan management with a number of tools to support all the stages of the plan lifecycle. We outline the architecture of the system, and show with a case study how planning processes can benefit from a system like SAGA.},

In order to contribute to reasonable resource allocation and targeted collaboration, this paper proposes a method of generating task network for emergency response based on the snowball procedure and an associated method of analyzing task network based on social network analysis. Firstly, the criticality of a task is evaluated using the proposed Weighted Proximity Prestige (WPP) index, which takes into account both the network structure and the dynamic urgency levels of response goals. Secondly, by calculating the WPP and observing its changing trend with time, shared resources for all response goals are identified. Thirdly, for each task, relations sink to it are ranked according their relative importance to provide explicit collaboration guidance. A case study based on the Beijing Flood Emergency Response Plan (2012 Amendment) is carried out to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The case study reveals that the WPP index particularly emphasizes tasks having dominating influence over on-site rescue actions, such as order maintenance, traffic route designing, and transportation resource coordination, which do not attract sufficient attentions in emergency response practices. Resources under severe contention as transit-related and man-power related tasks are identified based on the WPP index. Ranking the relations sinking to each task on a local scale provides more accurate information of working focuses to the agencies responsible for the task.},

The existing feature location techniques analyse each feature independently and perform a one-time analysis after being provided an initial input. As a result, these techniques are sensitive to the quality of the input. In this paper, we propose to address the above issues in feature location using an iterative context-aware approach. The underlying intuition is that features are not independent of each other, and the structure of source code resembles the structure of features. The distinguishing characteristics of the proposed approach are: (1) it takes into account the structural similarity between a feature and a program element to determine feature-element relevance and (2) it employs an iterative process to propagate the relevance of the established mappings between a feature and a program element to the neighbouring features and program elements. We evaluate our approach using two different systems, DirectBank, a small-scale industry financial system, and Linux kernel, a large-scale open-source operating system. Our evaluation suggests that the proposed approach is more robust and can significantly increase the recall of feature location with only a minor decrease of precision. },

The simulation is an efficient way to handle the complexity of modeling and optimization of real-world service delivery systems. However, typically developed custom simulation models lack standard architectures and limit the reuse of design and implementation artifacts across multiple models. In this work, following the design science research methodology, based on a formal model of service delivery systems and applying an adapted software product line (SPL) approach, we create a design artifact for building product lines of IT service delivery simulation models, which vastly simplify and reduce the cost of simulation model design and development. We evaluate the design artifact by constructing a product line of simulation models for a set of IBM's IT service delivery systems. We validate the proposed approach by comparing the simulation results obtained using our models with the results from the corresponding custom simulation models. The case study demonstrates that the proposed approach leads to 5â8 times reductions in the time required to design and develop related simulation models. The potential implications of the application of the proposed approach within an organization are quicker responses to changes in the business environment, more information to assist in managerial decisions, and reduced workload on the process reengineering specialists. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.},

A self-adaptive approach that integrates monitoring, analyzing, and actuation functionalities has the potential to accommodate an ever dynamically changing environment. This paper proposes an architecture-level self-adaptive framework with the aim of improving performance and reliability. To meet such a goal, this paper presents a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architectures (SAFCA) that consists of multiple well-documented architectural patterns in addition to monitoring and adaptive capabilities. With this framework, a system using an architectural alternative can activate another alternative at runtime to cope with increasing demands or to recover from failure. Five adaptation mechanisms have been developed for concept demonstration and evaluation; four focus on performance improvement and one deals with failover and reliability enhancement. We have performed a number of experiments with this framework. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive framework can mitigate the over-provisioning method commonly used in practice. As a result, resource usage becomes more efficient for most normal conditions, while the system is still able to effectively handle bursty or growing demands using an adaptive mechanism. The performance of {\{}SAFCA{\}} is also better than systems using only standalone architectural alternatives without an adaptation scheme. Moreover, the experimental results show that a fast recovery can be realized in the case of failure by conducting an architecture switchover to maintain the desired service. },

  abstract = {Context
During the definition of software product lines (SPLs) it is necessary to choose the components that appropriately fulfil a product's intended functionalities, including its quality requirements (i.e., security, performance, scalability). The selection of the appropriate set of assets from many possible combinations is usually done manually, turning this process into a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone task.
Objective
Our main objective is to determine whether, with the use of modeling tools, we can simplify and automate the definition process of a SPL, improving the selection process of reusable assets.
Method
We developed a model-driven strategy based on the identification of critical points (sensitivity points) inside the SPL architecture. This strategy automatically selects the components that appropriately match the product's functional and quality requirements. We validated our approach experimenting with different real configuration and derivation scenarios in a mobile healthcare SPL where we have worked during the last three years.
Results
Through our SPL experiment, we established that our approach improved in nearly 98{\%} the selection of reusable assets when compared with the unassisted analysis selection. However, using our approach there is an increment in the time required for the configuration corresponding to the learning curve of the proposed tools.
Conclusion
We can conclude that our domain-specific modeling approach significantly improves the software architect's decision making when selecting the most suitable combinations of reusable components in the context of a SPL.},

  abstract = {Software product line engineering pursues the efficient development of families of similar products. {\{}COPLIMO{\}} is an economic model that relies on {\{}COCOMO{\}} {\{}II{\}} to estimate the benefits of adopting a product line approach compared to developing the products one by one. Although {\{}COPLIMO{\}} is an ideal economic model to support decision making on the incremental development of a product line, it makes some simplifying assumptions that may produce high distortions in the estimates (e.g., {\{}COPLIMO{\}} takes for granted that all the products have the same size). This paper proposes a {\{}COPLIMO{\}} reformulation that avoids such assumptions and, consequently, improves the accuracy of the estimates. To support our proposal, we present an algorithm that infers the additional information that our {\{}COPLIMO{\}} reformulation requires from feature diagrams, which is a widespread notation to model the domain of a product line. },

  abstract = {Context
Increase in market competition is one of the main reasons for developing and maintaining families of systems, termed Product Lines (PLs). Managing those PLs is challenging, let alone the management of several related PLs. Currently, those PLs are managed separately or their relations are analyzed assuming explicit specification of dependencies or use of an underlying terminology. Such assumptions may not hold when developing the PLs in different departments or companies applying various engineering processes.
Objective
In this work we call for utilizing the knowledge gained from developing and maintaining different PLs in the same domain in order to recommend on improvements to the management of PLs.
Method
The suggested approach conducts domain knowledge extraction and cross PL analysis on feature diagrams â the main aid for modeling PL variability. The domain knowledge is extracted by applying similarity metrics, clustering, and mining techniques. Based on the created domain models, the approach performs cross PL analysis that examines relations in the domain models and generates improvement recommendations to existing PLs and overall management recommendations (e.g., merging or splitting PLs).
Results
The approach outcomes were evaluated by humans in a domain of mobile phones. The evaluation results may provide evidence that the outcomes of the approach in general and its recommendations in particular meet human perception of the given domain.
Conclusion
We conclude that through domain knowledge extraction and cross PL analysis the suggested approach may generate recommendations useful to the management of individual PLs, as well as to the overall management of different PLs in the same domain.},

In this paper we consider these testability issues and highlight some differences between optional versus alternative features. We then provide a graph based testing approach called the FIG Basis Path method that selects products and features for testing based on a feature dependency graph. We conduct a case study on several non-trivial SPLs and show that for these subjects, the FIG Basis Path method is as effective as testing all products, but tests no more than 24{\%} of the products in the SPL. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In DeltaCCS, predefined change directives are applied to core process semantics by overriding the {\{}CCS{\}} term rewriting rule in a determined way. On this basis, behavioral properties expressed in the Modal $\mu$-Calculus are verifiable for entire product-line specifications both product-by-product as well as in a family-based manner as usual. To overcome potential scalability limitations of those existing strategies, we propose a novel approach for incremental model checking of product lines. Therefore, variability-aware congruence notions and a respective normal form for DeltaCCS specifications allow for a rigorous local reasoning on the preservation of behavioral properties after varying {\{}CCS{\}} specifications. We present a prototypical DeltaCCS model checker implementation based on Maude and provide evaluation results obtained from various experiments concerning efficiency trade-offs compared to existing approaches. },

  abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering provides a promising approach for developing variant-rich software systems. But, testing of every product variant in isolation to ensure its correctness is in general not feasible due to the large number of product variants. Hence, a systematic approach that applies SPL reuse principles also to testing of SPLs in a safe and efficient way is essential. To address this issue, we propose a novel, model-based SPL testing framework that is based on a delta-oriented SPL test model and regression-based test artifact derivations. Test artifacts are incrementally constructed for every product variant by explicitly considering commonality and variability between two consecutive products under test. The resulting SPL testing process is proven to guarantee stable test coverage for every product variant and allows the derivation of redundancy-reduced, yet reliable retesting obligations. We compare our approach with an alternative SPL testing strategy by means of a case study from the automotive domain. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

We present the notions of residual and spinal testing. These notions allow for structuring the test process for {\{}SPLs{\}} by taking variability into account and extracting separate test suites for common and specific features of an SPL. The introduced notions of residual and spinal test suites allow for focusing on the newly introduced behavior and avoiding unnecessary re-test of the old one. Residual test suites are very conservative in that they require retesting the old behavior that can reach to new behavior. However, spinal test suites more aggressively prune the old tests and only focus on those test sequences that are necessary in reaching the new behavior. We show that residual testing is complete but does not usually lead to much reduction in the test-suite. In contrast, spinal testing is not necessarily complete but does reduce the test-suite. We give sufficient conditions on the implementation to guarantee completeness of spinal testing. Finally, we specify and analyze an example regarding the Ceiling Speed Monitoring Function from the European Train Control System. },

It provides a systematic mechanism for management to analyze all possible products and evaluate various reuse alternatives at the organizational level. The CoFAQ model facilitates decision-makers to optimize the SPF development process by determining which products are involved in the SPF (i.e. production strategy) and which reuse scenario for each module should be selected to implement the SPF toward minimum total developing cost under the constraints of satisfying functional and quality goals. A two-phase algorithm with heuristic (TPA) is developed to solve the model efficiently. Based on the TPA, the CoFAQ is reduced to a weighted set-covering problem for production strategy decision and a knapsack problem for the reuse scenario selection. An application of the model in mail server domain development is presented to illustrate how it has been used in practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract Software today is often developed for many deployment scenarios; the software may be adapted to sequential, concurrent, distributed, and even virtualized architectures. Since software performance can vary significantly depending on the target architecture, design decisions need to address which features to include and what performance to expect for different architectures. To make use of formal methods for these design decisions, system models need to range over deployment scenarios. For this purpose, it is desirable to lift aspects of low-level deployment to the abstraction level of the modeling language. This paper proposes an integration of deployment architectures in the Real-Time {\{}ABS{\}} language, with restrictions on processing resources. Real-Time {\{}ABS{\}} is a timed, abstract and behavioral specification language with a formal semantics and a Java-like syntax, that targets concurrent, distributed and object-oriented systems. A separation of concerns between execution cost at the object level and execution capacity at the deployment level makes it easy to compare the timing and performance of different deployment scenarios already during modeling. The language and associated simulation tool is demonstrated on examples and its semantics is formalized. },

In real-world scenarios, it is common to adopt multiple {\{}DSLs{\}} to solve different aspects of a specific problem. As any other software artefact, {\{}DSLs{\}} evolve independently in response to changing requirements, which leads to two challenges. First, the concepts from the {\{}DSLs{\}} have to be integrated into a single language. Second, models that conform to an old version of the language have to be migrated to conform to its current version. In this paper, we discuss how we tackled the challenge of integrating the {\{}DSLs{\}} that comprise the Cloud Application Modelling and Execution Language (CAMEL) by leveraging upon Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and Object Constraint Language (OCL).

It composes these to incrementally and symbolically analyze feature interactions.

  abstract = {Abstract A software product line (SPL) is a set of industrial software-intensive systems for configuring similar software products in which personalized feature sets are configured by different business teams. The integration of these feature sets can generate inconsistencies that are typically resolved through manual deliberation. This is a time-consuming process and leads to a potential loss of business resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can provide the best solution to address this issue autonomously through more efficient configurations, lesser inconsistencies and optimized resources. This paper presents the first literature review of both research and industrial {\{}AI{\}} applications to {\{}SPL{\}} configuration issues. Our results reveal only 19 relevant research works which employ traditional {\{}AI{\}} techniques on small feature sets with no real-life testing or application in industry. We categorize these works in a typology by identifying 8 perspectives of SPL. We also show that only 2 standard industrial {\{}SPL{\}} tools employ {\{}AI{\}} in a limited way to resolve inconsistencies. To inject more interest and application in this domain, we motivate and present future research directions. Particularly, using real-world {\{}SPL{\}} data, we demonstrate how predictive analytics (a state of the art {\{}AI{\}} technique) can separately model inconsistent and consistent patterns, and then predict inconsistencies in advance to help {\{}SPL{\}} designers during the configuration of a product. },

Furthermore, model-driven design frameworks for {\{}MPSoCs{\}} such as Xilinx' {\{}EDK{\}} or our own LavA-framework facilitate very fast system development. However, in this paper we argue that these design frameworks are not ideal from the development process perspective. Instead, we propose a software-centric approach that is based on the hardware {\{}API{\}} concept. The {\{}API{\}} is a representation of hardware components on the software level, which is generated from a hardware meta-model. It allows us to automatically derive a hardware structure based on access patterns in software, revealed by a static code analysis. This trick reduces the number of hardware details the developer needs to deal with and avoids configuration inconsistencies between the hardware and software levels by design. Furthermore, we present how the development process can benefit from the hardware API, when the {\{}API{\}} is interfaced with a configurable operating system. },

  abstract      = {Context The management of software development productivity is a key issue in software organizations, where the major drivers are lower cost and shorter time-to-market. Agile methods, including Extreme Programming and Scrum, have evolved as âlightâ approaches that simplify the software development process, potentially leading to increased team productivity. However, little empirical research has examined which factors do have an impact on productivity and in what way, when using agile methods. Objective Our objective is to provide a better understanding of the factors and mediators that impact agile team productivity. Method We have conducted a multiple-case study for 6 months in three large Brazilian companies that have been using agile methods for over 2 years. We have focused on the main productivity factors perceived by team members through interviews, documentation from retrospectives, and non-participant observation. Results We developed a novel conceptual framework, using thematic analysis to understand the possible mechanisms behind such productivity factors. Agile team management was found to be the most influential factor in achieving agile team productivity. At the intra-team level, the main productivity factors were team design (structure and work allocation) and member turnover. At the inter-team level, the main productivity factors were how well teams could be effectively coordinated by proper interfaces and other dependencies and avoiding delays in providing promised software to dependent teams. Conclusion Teams should be aware of the influence and magnitude of turnover, which has been shown negative for agile team productivity. Team design choices remain an important factor impacting team productivity, even more pronounced on agile teams that rely on teamwork and people factors. The intra-team coordination processes must be adjusted to enable productive work by considering priorities and pace between teams. Finally, the revised conceptual framework for agile team productivity supports further tests through confirmatory studies.},

Specifically, Architecture Technical Debt is regarded as sub-optimal architectural solutions taken to deliver fast that might hinder future feature development, which, in turn, would hinder agility. Objective This paper aims at improving software management by shedding light on the current factors responsible for the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt and to understand how it evolves over time. Method We conducted an exploratory multiple-case embedded case study in 7 sites at 5 large companies. We evaluated the results with additional cross-company interviews and an in-depth, company-specific case study in which we initially evaluate factors and models. Results We compiled a taxonomy of the factors and their influence in the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt, and we provide two qualitative models of how the debt is accumulated and refactored over time in the studied companies. We also list a set of exploratory propositions on possible refactoring strategies that can be useful as insights for practitioners and as hypotheses for further research. Conclusion Several factors cause constant and unavoidable accumulation of Architecture Technical Debt, which leads to development crises. Refactorings are often overlooked in prioritization and they are often triggered by development crises, in a reactive fashion. Some of the factors are manageable, while others are external to the companies. {\{}ATD{\}} needs to be made visible, in order to postpone the crises according to the strategic goals of the companies.

  abstract = {Context
A common way to represent product lines is with variability modeling. Yet, there are different ways to extract and organize relevant characteristics of variability. Comprehensibility of these models and the ease of creating models are important for the efficiency of any variability management approach.
Objective
The goal of this paper is to investigate the comprehensibility of two common styles to organize variability into models â hierarchical and constrained â where the dependencies between choices are specified either through the hierarchy of the model or as cross-cutting constraints, respectively.
Method
We conducted a controlled experiment with a sample of 90 participants who were students with prior training in modeling. Each participant was provided with two variability models specified in Common Variability Language (CVL) and was asked to answer questions requiring interpretation of provided models. The models included 9â20 nodes and 8â19 edges and used the main variability elements. After answering the questions, the participants were asked to create a model based on a textual description.
Results
The results indicate that the hierarchical modeling style was easier to comprehend from a subjective point of view, but there was also a significant interaction effect with the degree of dependency in the models, that influenced objective comprehension. With respect to model creation, we found that the use of a constrained modeling style resulted in higher correctness of variability models.
Conclusions
Prior exposure to modeling style and the degree of dependency among elements in the model determine what modeling style a participant chose when creating the model from natural language descriptions. Participants tended to choose a hierarchical style for modeling situations with high dependency and a constrained style for situations with low dependency. Furthermore, the degree of dependency also influences the comprehension of the variability model.},

  abstract = {Context
Two recent mapping studies which were intended to verify the current state of replication of empirical studies in Software Engineering (SE) identified two sets of studies: empirical studies actually reporting replications (published between 1994 and 2012) and a second group of studies that are concerned with definitions, classifications, processes, guidelines, and other research topics or themes about replication work in empirical software engineering research (published between 1996 and 2012).
Objective
In this current article, our goal is to analyze and discuss the contents of the second set of studies about replications to increase our understanding of the current state of the work on replication in empirical software engineering research.
Method
We applied the systematic literature review method to build a systematic mapping study, in which the primary studies were collected by two previous mapping studies covering the period 1996â2012 complemented by manual and automatic search procedures that collected articles published in 2013.
Results
We analyzed 37 papers reporting studies about replication published in the last 17years. These papers explore different topics related to concepts and classifications, presented guidelines, and discuss theoretical issues that are relevant for our understanding of replication in our field. We also investigated how these 37 papers have been cited in the 135 replication papers published between 1994 and 2012.
Conclusions
Replication in SE still lacks a set of standardized concepts and terminology, which has a negative impact on the replication work in our field. To improve this situation, it is important that the SE research community engage on an effort to create and evaluate taxonomy, frameworks, guidelines, and methodologies to fully support the development of replications.},

  abstract = {Context: Variability management is a key activity in software product line engineering. This paper focuses on managing rationale information during the decision-making activities that arise during variability management. By decision-making we refer to systematic problem solving by considering and evaluating various alternatives. Rationale management is a branch of science that enables decision-making based on the argumentation of stakeholders while capturing the reasons and justifications behind these decisions. Objective: Decision-making should be supported to identify variability in domain engineering and to resolve variation points in application engineering. We capture the rationale behind variability management decisions. The captured rationale information is useful to evaluate future changes of variability models as well as to handle future instantiations of variation points. We claim that maintaining rationale will enhance the longevity of variability models. Furthermore, decisions should be performed using a formal communication between domain engineering and application engineering. Method: We initiate the novel area of issue-based variability management (IVM) by extending variability management with rationale management. The key contributions of this paper are: (i) an issue-based variability management methodology (IVMM), which combines questions, options and criteria (QOC) and a specific variability approach; (ii) a meta-model for IVMM and a process for variability management and (iii) a tool for the methodology, which was developed by extending an open source rationale management tool. Results: Rationale approaches (e.g. questions, options and criteria) guide distributed stakeholders when selecting choices for instantiating variation points. Similarly, rationale approaches also aid the elicitation of variability and the evaluation of changes. The rationale captured within the decision-making process can be reused to perform future decisions on variability. Conclusion: IVMM was evaluated comparatively based on an experimental survey, which provided evidence that IVMM is more effective than a variability modeling approach that does not use issues. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {More and more organizations adopt software product lines to leverage extensive reuse and deliver a multitude of benefits such as increased quality and productivity and a decrease in cost and time-to-market of their software development. When compared to the vast amount of research on developing product lines, relatively little work has been dedicated to the actual use of product lines to derive individual products, i.e., the process of product derivation. Existing approaches to product derivation have been developed independently for different aims and purposes. While the definition of a general approach applicable to every domain may not be possible, it would be interesting for researchers and practitioners to know which activities are common in existing approaches, i.e., what are the key activities in product derivation. In this paper we report on how we compared two product derivation approaches developed by the authors in two different, independent research projects. Both approaches independently sought to identify product derivation activities, one through a process reference model and the other through a tool-supported derivation approach. Both approaches have been developed and validated in research industry collaborations with different companies. Through the comparison of the approaches we identify key product derivation activities. We illustrate the activities' importance with examples from industry collaborations. To further validate the activities, we analyze three existing product derivation approaches for their support for these activities. The validation provides evidence that the identified activities are relevant to product derivation and we thus conclude that they should be considered (e.g., as a checklist) when developing or evaluating a product derivation approach. },

This paper contributes to the body of research in quality and model driven software engineering.

The novel approach with supporting tools enables the systematic development of high quality software by merging benefits of knowledge modelling and management, and model driven architecture design enhanced with domain-specific quality attributes. The whole design flow of software engineering is semi-automatic; specifying quality requirements, transforming quality requirements to architecture design, representing quality properties in architectural models, predicting quality fulfilment from architectural models, and finally, measuring quality aspects from implemented source code. The semi-automatic design flow is exemplified by the ongoing development of a secure middleware for peer-to-peer embedded systems.},

Objective This study conducts a survey on existing research on {\{}KM{\}} initiatives in software testing, in order to identify the state of the art in the area as well as the future research. Aspects such as purposes, types of knowledge, technologies and research type are investigated. Method The mapping study was performed by searching seven electronic databases. We considered studies published until December 2013. The initial resulting set was comprised of 562 studies. From this set, a total of 13 studies were selected. For these 13, we performed snowballing and direct search to publications of researchers and research groups that accomplished these studies. Results From the mapping study, we identified 15 studies addressing {\{}KM{\}} initiatives in software testing that have been reviewed in order to extract relevant information on a set of research questions. Conclusions Although only a few studies were found that addressed {\{}KM{\}} initiatives in software testing, the mapping shows an increasing interest in the topic in the recent years. Reuse of test cases is the perspective that has received more attention. From the {\{}KM{\}} point of view, most of the studies discuss aspects related to providing automated support for managing testing knowledge by means of a {\{}KM{\}} system. Moreover, as a main conclusion, the results show that {\{}KM{\}} is pointed out as an important strategy for increasing test effectiveness, as well as for improving the selection and application of suited techniques, methods and test cases. On the other hand, inadequacy of existing {\{}KM{\}} systems appears as the most cited problem related to applying {\{}KM{\}} in software testing. },

We present a domain ontology called Kumbang for modelling the variability in software product families. Kumbang synthesises previous approaches to modelling variability in software product families. In addition, it incorporates modelling constructs developed in the product configuration domain for modelling the variability in non-software products. The modelling concepts include components and features with compositional structure and attributes, the interfaces of components and connections between them, and constraints. The semantics of Kumbang is rigorously described using natural language and a UML profile. We provide preliminary proof of concept for Kumbang: the domain ontology has been provided with a formal semantics by implementing a translation into a general-purpose knowledge representation language with formal semantics and inference support. A prototype tool for resolving variability has been implemented.},

All of these ideas are essentially a form of aspect-oriented interface between object-oriented and cross-cutting modules, but the representation of this interface differs. Previous works have studied maintenance benefits of AO programs compared to OO programs, by usually looking at a single AO interface. Other works have looked at several AO interfaces, but only on relatively small systems or systems with only one type of aspectual behavior. Thus, there is a need for a study that examines large, realistic systems for several AO interfaces to determine what problems arise and in which interface(s). The main contribution of this work is a rigorous empirical study that evaluates the effectiveness of these proposals for 4 different AO interfaces by applying them to 35 different releases of a software product line called MobileMedia and 50 different releases of a Web application called Health Watcher. In total, over 400k lines of code were studied across all releases. Our comparative analysis using quantitative metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer shows the strengths and weaknesses of these AO interface proposals. Our change impact analysis shows the design stability provided by each of these recent proposals for AO interfaces. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

As a result, modern concepts for separation of concerns and software reuse are widely ignored, as developers worry about the thereby induced memory and performance overhead. Especially object-oriented programming (OOP) is still little in demand. For the development of highly configurable fine-grained system software product lines, however, separation of concerns (SoC) is a crucial property. As the overhead of object-orientation is not acceptable in this domain, we propose aspect-oriented programming (AOP) as an alternative. Compared to OOP, AOP makes it possible to reach similar or even better separation of concerns with significantly smaller memory footprints. In a case study for an embedded system product line the memory costs for SoC could be reduced from 148-236{\%} to 2-10{\%} by using AOP instead of OOP. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

  abstract = {Abstract The use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) has become a successful technique in the development of complex systems. Consequently, nowadays we can find a large variety of {\{}DSLs{\}} for diverse purposes. However, not all these {\{}DSLs{\}} are completely different; many of them share certain commonalities coming from similar modeling patterns â such as state machines or petri nets â used for several purposes. In this scenario, the challenge for language designers is to take advantage of the commonalities existing among similar {\{}DSLs{\}} by reusing, as much as possible, formerly defined language constructs. The objective is to leverage previous engineering efforts to minimize implementation from scratch. To this end, recent research in software language engineering proposes the use of product line engineering, thus introducing the notion of language product lines. Nowadays, there are several approaches that result useful in the construction of language product lines. In this article, we report on an effort for organizing the literature on language product line engineering. More precisely, we propose a definition for the life-cycle of language product lines, and we use it to analyze the capabilities of current approaches. In addition, we provide a mapping between each approach and the technological space it supports. },

Model migration strategies aim to co-evolve models and metamodels together, but their application is currently not fully automatizable and is thus cumbersome and error prone. We introduce the Variable MetaModel (VMM) strategy to address the evolution of the reusable model assets of a model-based Software Product Line. The VMM strategy applies variability modeling ideas to express the evolution of the metamodel in terms of commonalities and variabilities. When the metamodel evolves, changes are automatically formalized into the VMM and models that conform to previous versions of the metamodel continue to conform to the VMM, thus eliminating the need for migration. We have applied both the traditional migration strategy and the VMM strategy to a retrospective case study that includes 13 years of evolution of our industrial partner, an induction hobs manufacturer. The comparison between the two strategies shows better results for the VMM strategy in terms of model indirection, automation, and trust leak. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

While the developed algorithms often outperform their {\{}CPU{\}} counterparts, it is not beneficial to keep processing devices idle while overutilizing others. Therefore, an approach is needed that efficiently distributes a workload on available (co-)processors while providing accurate performance estimates for the query optimizer. In this paper, we contribute heuristics that optimize query processing for response time and throughput simultaneously via inter-device parallelism. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the new approach achieves speedups up to 1.85 compared to state-of-the-art approaches while preserving accurate performance estimations. In a further series of experiments, we evaluate our approach on two new use cases: joining and sorting. Furthermore, we use a simulation to assess the performance of our approach for systems with multiple co-processors and derive some general rules that impact performance in those systems. },

Home computers with access to the Internet are one of the weaker links as they are typically not as well protected as computers in the corporate world. Malicious actors can not only target such computers but also use them to launch attacks against other systems connected to the Internet, thus posing severe threats to data and infrastructure as well as disrupting electronic commerce. This paper investigates the factors that affect the use of security protection strategies by home computer users in relation to a specific, but crucial security technology for home â a software firewall. This paper proposes individuals' concern for privacy, awareness of common security measures, attitude towards security and privacy protection technologies, and computer anxiety as important antecedents that have an impact on the users' decision to adopt a software firewall. The results of our study suggest that attitude plays a more important role than perceived usefulness in shaping users' intention to use firewalls. We attribute this interesting finding to the non-functional nature of firewall systems that work best in the background with a complex relationship to users' productivity. Hence, the results add to our current understanding of Technology Acceptance Model vis-{\`{a}}-vis technologies that serve non-functional needs such as security. We then present a set of guidelines to home computer users, Internet Service Providers, e-commerce companies, and the government to increase home users' adoption rate of privacy and security protection technologies. },

  abstract = {Automated production systems (aPSs) are often in operation for several decades. Due to a multiplicity of reasons, these assets have to be maintained and modified over the time multiple times and with respect to multiple engineering domains. An increased economic pressure demands to perform these tasks in an optimized way. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate change effects with respect to multidisciplinary interdependences, required surrounding non-functional tasks and the effort and costs included in each step. This paper outlines available cost estimation methods for PLC-based automation and Information Systems (ISs). We introduce Karlsruhe Architectural Maintainability Prediction for aPS (KAMP4aPS), an approach to estimate the necessary maintenance tasks to be performed and their related costs for the domain of aPSs by extending KAMP, which is limited to change propagation analysis on ISs. KAMP requires a metamodel to derive these tasks automatically. Unfortunately, a domain spanning metamodel is missing for aPSs. Hence, we need to develop a part of the metamodel derived from an AutomationML description for the chosen demonstrator at first. Finally, we apply and compare different estimation methods and KAMP4aPS to analyze the exchange of a fieldbus system as exemplary change scenario on a lab size plant to demonstrate the benefits of our discipline-spanning approach.},

Objective This case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium-scale organization decided to adopt software platforms. The study also reveals how new trends in software engineering (i.e. agile methods, distributed development, and flat management structures) interplayed with the chosen platform strategy. Method We used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at a medium-scale company in Scandinavia. We conducted 16 in-depth interviews with representatives of eight different teams, three of which were working on three separate platforms. The collected data was analyzed using Grounded Theory. Results The findings identify four classes of challenges, namely: business challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges, and people challenges. The article explains how these findings can be used to help researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions and required tool support. Conclusion The organization's decision to adopt a software platform strategy introduced a number of challenges. These challenges need to be understood and addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse. Researchers need to further investigate issues such as supportive organizational structures for platform development, the role of agile methods in software platforms, tool support for testing and continuous integration in the platform context, and reuse recommendation systems. },

  abstract = {In the last few years, Model-Driven Development (MDD), Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD), and Component-Based Software Development (CBSD) have become interesting alternatives for the design and construction of complex distributed applications. Although these methodological approaches share the principle of separation of concerns and their further integration as key factors to obtaining high-quality and evolvable large software systems, they usually each address this principle from their own particular perspective. In the present work, we combine Component-Based and Aspect-Oriented Software Developments in a Model Driven software process targeted at the development of complex systems. This process constitutes an enhancement of the separation of concerns by allowing the isolation of crosscutting concerns in both Platform Independent and Platform Specific models. Following a pure {\{}MDD{\}} philosophy, a set of model transformations are used to generate the system, from preliminary models to the final source code for the Corba Component Model platform. A twofold empirical analysis was used to evaluate the approach's benefits in terms of two internal quality attributes: modularity and complexity. Conclusions were drawn from this evaluation regarding other quality attributes correlated with these two â stability, changeability, error-proneness, and reusability. An Eclipse plug-in was developed to drive the development of the entire system from early modeling to late deployment stages. },

Thus, detecting conflicts between requirements is essential for successful product line development. Formal methods have been proposed to address this problem, however, they are hard to understand by non-experts and are limited to restricted domains. In addition, there is no overall process that covers all the steps for managing conflicts. We propose an approach for systematically identifying and managing requirements conflicts, which is based on requirements partition in natural language and supported by a tool.

A software product line is a set of software products sharing a set of common features but containing variation points. Successful SPLE requires making selection decisions at variation points effectively and efficiently. A significant challenge is how to identify, represent and manage the inter-dependency of selection decisions for requirements. We developed the concept of a meta-model for requirement decision models to bring formalism and consistency to the structure and to model inter-dependencies between requirement selection decisions. Here we present a meta-model for requirement selection decisions that includes inter-dependencies and we use a mobile phone worked example to illustrate our approach. To support our method, we developed two separate tools, V-Define (for domain decision model construction) and V-Resolve (for new product derivation). Finally the results of a metal processing product line case study using the tools are described. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

This represents a paradigm shift in technical and professional education, as well as the collaborative processes utilized in creating and maintaining complex multi-stakeholder talent development systems. In doing so, however, this paradigm shift also presents a huge challenge: education and public sectors are typically not familiar with matured product development and (project) management principles and often do not apply proven industry practices to the definition, design, delivery and improvement of their educational products. The evaluation, acceptance and ultimate implementation of those principles departs from the traditional (United States) culture of education, as it applies new instructional design processes, change implementation processes, and feedback/assessment models. Therefore, critical review of such methods, innovative development of transfer options and human factors management in successfully achieving the required systems change were identified, and include explanation, understanding, acceptance, personal development, and trust. Using a case study approach, this paper will analyze several highly visible and innovative adaptations of industry and educational standards which were accepted and released by all relevant stakeholders. By leveraging subject matter experts from both the industry and academic settings, Michigan Advanced Technician Training (MAT2) formed organizational and working teams comprised of the primary government, industry, and academic stakeholder groups and established a workable context for a knowledge transfer of best practice industry standards. Said standards were applied bi-directionally by academic providers and partnering manufacturing enterprises, and now serve as best practice examples for post-secondary systems of apprenticeship education.},

First, features are mapped to problem frames using heuristics derived from feature modeling and feature mapping units. Requirements are then identified and analyzed to ensure that they are fully satisfied. Finally, a solution modeling method maps the problem frames to architectural components.

However, effective reuse is not easy and only a limited portion of reusable models actually offers effective evidence regarding their appropriateness, usability and/or effectiveness. Focusing reuse on a particular domain, such as marine ecology, allows us to narrow the scope; and along with a systematic approach such as software product line development, helps us to potentially improving reuse. From our experiences developing a subdomain-oriented software product line (SPL for the marine ecology subdomain), in this paper we describe semantic resources created for assisting this development and thus promoting systematic software reuse. The main contributions of our work are focused on the definition of a standard conceptual model for marine ecology applications together with a set of services and guides which assist the process of product derivation. The services are structured in a service taxonomy (as a specialization of the ISO 19119 std) in which we create a new set of categories and services built over a conceptual model for marine ecology applications. We also define and exemplify a set of guides for composing the services of the taxonomy in order to fulfill different functionalities of particular systems in the subdomain.},

Generally these applications are developed in order to meet a demands/specific business need of the company without worrying of interacting with another existing system. The area of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) is able to provide all techniques and tools in order to integrate heterogeneous applications software ecosystem of companies. The Guaran{\'{a}} {\{}DSL{\}} is a language that enables designing conceptual models of integration solutions using a concrete graphical and intuitive syntax. Integrating the applications is not a trivial task and solution development involves addition of costs (time and resources), risks such as the appearance of bugs that most often are observed only after the implementation of the conceptual model. In this paper we propose a simulation model using Petri Nets that enable the analysis of the behavior of an integration solution developed to a real-world integration problem at Uniju{\'{i}} University. },

  abstract = {Software organizations specify their software processes so that process knowledge can be systematically reused across projects. However, different projects may require different processes. Defining a separate process for each potential project context is expensive and error-prone, since these processes must simultaneously evolve in a consistent manner. Moreover, an organization cannot envision all possible project contexts in advance because several variables may be involved, and these may also be combined in different ways. This problem is even worse in small companies since they usually cannot afford to define more than one process. Software process lines are a specific type of software product lines, in the software process domain. A benefit of software process lines is that they allow software process customization with respect to a context. In this article we propose a model-driven approach for software process lines specification and configuration. The article also presents two industrial case studies carried out at two small Chilean software development companies. Both companies have benefited from applying our approach to their processes: new projects are now developed using custom processes, process knowledge is systematically reused, and the total time required to customize a process is much shorter than before.{\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Abstract Software product line engineering is a promising paradigm for developing software intensive systems. Among their proven benefits are reduced time to market, better asset reuse and improved software quality. To achieve this, the collection of products of the product line are specified by means of product line models. Feature Models (FMs) are a common notation to represent product lines that express the set of feature combinations that software products can have. Experience shows that these models can have defects. Defects in {\{}FMs{\}} be inherited to the products configured from these models. Consequently, defects must be early identified and corrected. Several works reported in scientific literature, deal with identification of defects in FMs. However, only few of these proposals are able to explain how to fix defects, and only some corrections are suggested. This paper proposes a new method to detect all possible corrections from a defective product line model. The originality of the contribution is that corrections can be found when the method systematically eliminates dependencies from the FMs. The proposed method was applied on 78 distinct {\{}FMs{\}} with sizes up to 120 dependencies. Evaluation indicates that the method proposed in this paper scale up, is accurate, and sometimes useful in real scenarios. },

A key challenge in domain analysis is to extract features automatically from related product artifacts. Compared with other kinds of artifacts, high volume of descriptions can be collected from App marketplaces (such as Google Play and Apple Store) easily when developing a new mobile application (App), so it is essential for the success of domain analysis to gain features and relationships from them using data analysis techniques. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine domain knowledge from App descriptions automatically, where the information of features in a single App description is firstly extracted and formally described by a Concern-based Description Model (CDM), which is based on predefined rules of feature extraction and a modified topic modeling method; then the overall knowledge in the domain is identified by classifying, clustering and merging the knowledge in the set of CDMs and topics, and the results are formalized by a Data-based Raw Domain Model (DRDM). Furthermore, we propose a quantified evaluation method for prioritizing the knowledge in DRDM. The proposed approach is validated by a series of experiments.},

  abstract = {Context Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the discipline of controlling the evolution of large and complex software systems. Over the years many different {\{}SCM{\}} systems sharing similar concepts have been implemented from scratch. Since these concepts usually are hard-wired into the respective program code, reuse is hardly possible. Objective Our objective is to create a model-driven product line for {\{}SCM{\}} systems. By explicitly describing the different concepts using models, reuse can be performed on the modeling level. Since models are executable, the need for manual programming is eliminated. Furthermore, by providing a library of loosely coupled modules, we intend to support flexible composition of {\{}SCM{\}} systems. Method We developed a method and a tool set for model-driven software product line engineering which we applied to the {\{}SCM{\}} domain. For domain analysis, we applied the {\{}FORM{\}} method, resulting in a layered feature model for {\{}SCM{\}} systems. Furthermore, we developed an executable object-oriented domain model which was annotated with features from the feature model. A specific {\{}SCM{\}} system is configured by selecting features from the feature model and elements of the domain model realizing these features. Results Due to the orthogonality of both feature model and domain model, a very large number of {\{}SCM{\}} systems may be configured. We tested our approach by creating instances of the product line which mimic wide-spread systems such as CVS, GIT, Mercurial, and Subversion. Conclusion The experiences gained from this project demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to model-driven software product line engineering. Furthermore, our work advances the state of the art in the domain of {\{}SCM{\}} systems since it support the modular composition of {\{}SCM{\}} systems at the model rather than the code level. },

Two elementary mutation operators, insertion and omission, are exemplarily applied to a hierarchy of graph-based models of increasing expressive power including directed graphs, event sequence graphs, finite-state machines and statecharts. Test cases generated based on the mutated models (mutants) are used to determine not only whether each mutant can be killed but also whether there are any faults in the corresponding system under consideration (SUC) developed based on the original model. Novelties of our approach are: (1) evaluation of the fault detection capability (in terms of revealing faults in the SUC) of test sets generated based on the mutated models, and (2) superseding of the great variety of existing mutation operators by iterations and combinations of the two proposed elementary operators. Three case studies were conducted on industrial and commercial real-life systems to demonstrate the feasibility of using the proposed {\{}MBMT{\}} approach in detecting faults in SUC, and to analyze its characteristic features. Our experimental data suggest that test sets generated based on the mutated models created by insertion operators are more effective in revealing faults in {\{}SUC{\}} than those generated by omission operators. Worth noting is that test sets following the {\{}MBMT{\}} approach were able to detect faults in the systems that were tested by manufacturers and independent testing organizations before they were released.},

  abstract = {Testing software product lines (SPLs) is very challenging due to a high degree of variability leading to an enormous number of possible products. The vast majority of today's testing approaches for SPLs validate products individually using different kinds of reuse techniques for testing. Because of their reusability and adaptability capabilities, model-based approaches are suitable to describe variability and are therefore frequently used for implementation and testing purposes of SPLs. Due to the enormous number of possible products, individual product testing becomes more and more infeasible. Pairwise testing offers one possibility to test a subset of all possible products. However, according to the best of our knowledge, there is no contribution discussing and rating this approach in the SPL context. In this contribution, we provide a mapping between feature models describing the common and variable parts of an SPL and a reusable test model in the form of statecharts. Thereby, we interrelate feature model-based coverage criteria and test model-based coverage criteria such as control and data flow coverage and are therefore able to discuss the potentials and limitations of pairwise testing. We pay particular attention to test requirements for feature interactions constituting a major challenge in SPL engineering. We give a concise definition of feature dependencies and feature interactions from a testing point of view, and we discuss adequacy criteria for SPL coverage under pairwise feature interaction testing and give a generalization to the T-wise case. The concept and implementation of our approach are evaluated by means of a case study from the automotive domain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

To make this possible, software designers should be able to predict quality attributes by reasoning on a model of the system under development. Although there exists a variety of quality-driven analysis techniques for software systems, only a few work address software product lines. This paper describes how probabilistic model checking techniques and tools can be used to verify non-functional properties of different configurations of a software product line. We propose a model-based approach that enables software engineers to assess their design solutions for software product lines in the early stages of development. Furthermore, we discuss how the analysis time can be surprisingly reduced by applying parametric model checking instead of classic model checking. The results show that the parametric approach is able to substantially alleviate the verification time and effort required to analyze non-functional properties of software product lines. },

The paper provides four contributions to the study of model-driven configuration of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure by (1) explaining how virtual machine configurations can be captured in feature models, (2) describing how these models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) for configuration and energy consumption optimization, (3) showing how optimal auto-scaling configurations can be derived from these {\{}CSPs{\}} with a constraint solver, and (4) presenting a case study showing the energy consumption/cost reduction produced by this model-driven approach. },

  abstract = {Abstract Modern software systems are frequently required to be adaptive in order to cope with constant changes. Unfortunately, service-oriented systems built with WS-BPEL are still too rigid. In this paper, we propose a novel model-driven approach to supporting the development of dynamically adaptive WS-BPEL based systems. We model the system functionality with two distinct but highly correlated parts: a stable part called the base model describing the flow logic aspect and a volatile part called the variable model describing the decision logic aspect. We develop an aspect-oriented method to weave the base model and the variable model together so that runtime changes can be applied to the variable model without affecting the base model. A model-driven platform has been implemented to support the development of adaptive WS-BPEL processes. In-lab experiments show that our approach has low performance overhead. A real-life case study also validates the applicability of our approach. },

Second, we supplement these figures with qualitative data obtained from some semi-structured, in-depth interviews with {\{}MDE{\}} practitioners, and, in particular, through describing the practices of four commercial organizations as they adopted a model driven engineering approach to their software development practices. Using in-depth semi-structured interviewing, we invited practitioners to reflect on their experiences and selected four to use as exemplars or case studies. In documenting some details of their attempts to deploy model driven practices, we identify a number of factors, in particular the importance of complex organizational, managerial and social factorsâas opposed to simple technical factorsâthat appear to influence the relative success, or failure, of the endeavor. Three of the case study companies describe genuine success in their use of model driven development, but explain that as examples of organizational change management, the successful deployment of model driven engineering appears to require: a progressive and iterative approach; transparent organizational commitment and motivation; integration with existing organizational processes and a clear business focus. },

These proposals have been classified generically as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and share common concepts and terms that need to be abstracted, discussed and understood. This paper presents a survey on {\{}MDE{\}} based on a unified conceptual model that clearly identifies and relates these essential concepts, namely the concepts of system, model, metamodel, modeling language, transformations, software platform, and software product. In addition, this paper discusses the terminologies relating MDE, MDD, {\{}MDA{\}} and others. This survey is based on earlier work, however, contrary to those, it intends to give a simple, broader and integrated view of the essential concepts and respective terminology commonly involved in the MDE, answering to key questions such as: What is a model? What is the relation between a model and a metamodel? What are the key facets of a modeling language? How can I use models in the context of a software development process? What are the relations between models and source code artefacts and software platforms? and What are the relations between MDE, MDD, {\{}MDA{\}} and other {\{}MD{\}} approaches? },

The methodology includes {\{}CS{\}} learning variability modelling using the feature-based approaches borrowed from the {\{}SW{\}} engineering domain. Firstly, we define the {\{}CS{\}} learning domain using the known educational framework {\{}TPACK{\}} (Technology, Pedagogy And Content Knowledge). By learning variability we mean the attributes of the framework extracted and represented as feature models with multiple values. Therefore, the {\{}CS{\}} learning variability represents the problem domain. Meta-programming is considered as a solution domain. Both are represented by feature models. The {\{}GLO{\}} design task is formulated as mapping the problem domain model on the solution domain model. Next, we present the design framework to design {\{}GLOs{\}} manually or semi-automatically. The multi-level separation of concepts, model representation and transformation forms the conceptual background. Its theoretical background includes: (a) a formal definition of feature-based models; (b) a graph-based and set-based definition of meta-programming concepts; (c) transformation rules to support the model mapping; (d) a computational Abstract State Machine model to define the processes and design tool for developing GLOs. We present the architecture and some characteristics of the tool. The tool enables to improve the {\{}GLO{\}} design process significantly (in terms of time and quality) and to achieve a higher quality and functionality of {\{}GLOs{\}} themselves (in terms of the parameter space enlargement for reuse and adaptation). We demonstrate the appropriateness of the methodology in the real teaching setting. In this paper, we present the case study that analyses three robot-oriented {\{}GLOs{\}} as the higher-level specifications. Then, using the meta-language processor, we are able to produce, from the specifications, the concrete robot control programs on demand automatically and to demonstrate teaching algorithms visually by robot's actions. We evaluate the approach from technological and pedagogical perspectives using the known structural metrics. Also, we indicate the merits and demerits of the approach. The main contribution and originality of the paper is the seamless integration of two known technologies (feature modelling and meta-programming) in designing robot-oriented {\{}GLOs{\}} and their supporting tools. },

As modern software systems are also expected to be reused, extended, and adapted over a much longer lifetime than ever before, ensuring the maintainability of such systems is equally gaining relevance. In this paper, we present the development, optimization and maintenance of MoSo-PoLiTe, a framework for Software Product Line (SPL) testing, as a novel case study for rapid prototyping via metamodelling and programmed graph transformations. The first part of the case study evaluates the use of programmed graph transformations for optimizing an existing, hand-written system (MoSo-PoLiTe) via rapid prototyping of various strategies. In the second part, we present a complete re-engineering of the hand-written system with programmed graph transformations and provide a critical comparison of both implementations.Our results and conclusions indicate that metamodelling and programmed graph transformation are not only suitable techniques for rapid prototyping, but also lead to more maintainable systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In particular in conjunction with model-driven engineering, {\{}SPL{\}} engineering promises high productivity benefits. There is however, a lack of support for systematic management of {\{}SPL{\}} evolution, which is an important success factor as a product line often represents a long term investment. In this article, we present a model-driven approach for managing {\{}SPL{\}} evolution on feature level. To reduce complexity we use model fragments to cluster related elements. The relationships between these fragments are specified using feature model concepts itself leading to a specific kind of feature model called EvoFM. A configuration of EvoFM represents an evolution step and can be transformed to a concrete instance of the product line (i.e., a feature model for the corresponding point in time). Similarly, automatic transformations allow the derivation of an EvoFM from a given set of feature models. This enables retrospective analysis of historic evolution and serves as a starting point for introduction of EvoFM, e.g., to plan future evolution steps. },

  abstract = {Process modeling is an expensive task that needs to encompass requirements of different stakeholders, assure compliance with different standards, and enable the flexible adaptivity to newly emerging requirements in today's dynamic global market. Identifying reusability of process models is a promising direction towards reducing the costs of process modeling. Recent research has offered several solutions. Such solutions promote effective and formally sound methods for variability modeling and configuration management. However, ensuring behavioral validity of reused process models with respect to the original process models (often referred to as reference process models) is still an open research challenge. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose the notion of business process families by building upon the well-known software engineering disciplineâsoftware product line engineering. Business process families comprise (i) a variability modeling perspective, (ii) a process model template (or reference model), and (iii) mappings between (i) and (ii). For business process families, we propose a correct validation algorithm ensuring that each member of a business process family adheres to the core intended behavior that is specified in the process model template. The proposed validation approach is based on the use of Description Logics, variability is represented by using the well-known Feature Models and behavior of process models is considered in terms of control flow patterns. The paper also reports on the experience gained in two external trial cases and results obtained by measuring the tractability of the implementation of the proposed validation approach. },

  abstract = {Software product line (SPL) is a software engineering paradigm for software development. SPL is important in promoting software reuse, leading to higher productivity and quality. A software product within a product line often has specific functionalities that are not common to all other products within the product line. Those specific functionalities are termed âvariant featuresâ in a product line. SPL paradigm involves the modeling of variant features. However, little work in SPL investigates and addresses the modeling of variant features specific to UI. UML is the de facto modeling language for object-oriented software systems. It is known that UML needs better support in modeling UIs. Thus, much research developed UML extensions to improve UML support in modeling UIs. Yet little of this work is related to developing such extensions for modeling UIs for SPLs in which variant features specific to user interfaces (UI) modeling must be addressed. This research develops a UML extension, WUIML, to address these problems. WUIML defines elements for modeling variant features specific to UIs for Web-based SPLs. The model elements in WUIML extend from the metaclass and of the UML2.0 metamodel. WUIML integrates the modeling of variant features specific to UIs to UML. For example, in a Web-based patient registration SPL, member products targeting British users may use British date format in the user interface, while member products targeting United States users may use United States date format in the user interface. Thus, this is a variant feature for this product line. WUIML defines a model element, XOR, to represent such exclusive or conditions in a product line user interface model. WUIML would reduce SPL engineers' efforts needed in UI development. To validate the WUIML research outcome, a case study was conducted. The results of this empirical study indicate that modeling UIs for Web-based SPLs using WUIML is more effective and efficient than using standard UML. {\textcopyright} 2006, IGI Global.

We address variability at the behavioural level by modelling the family behaviour by means of a Modal Transition System (MTS) with an associated set of variability constraints expressed over action labels. An MTS is a Labelled Transition System (LTS) which distinguishes between optional and mandatory transitions. Steered by the variability constraints, the inclusion or exclusion of labelled transitions in an LTS refining the MTS determines the family's possible product behaviour. We formalise this as a special-purpose refinement relation for MTSs, which differs fundamentally from the classical one, and show how to use it for the definition and derivation of valid product behaviour starting from product family behaviour. We also present a variability-aware action-based branching-time modal temporal logic to express properties over MTSs, and demonstrate a number of results regarding the preservation of logical properties from family to product behaviour. These results pave the way for the more efficient family-based analyses of MTSs, limiting the need for product-by-product analyses of LTSs. Finally, we define a high-level modal process algebra for the specification of MTSs. The complete framework is implemented in a model-checking tool: given the behaviour of a product family modelled as an MTS with an additional set of variability constraints, it allows the explicit generation of valid product behaviour as well as the efficient on-the-fly verification of logical properties over family and product behaviour alike.},

  abstract = {Abstract Business processes usually do not exist as singular entities that can be managed in isolation, but rather as families of business process variants. When modelling such families of variants, analysts are confronted with the choice between modelling each variant separately, or modelling multiple or all variants in a single model. Modelling each variant separately leads to a proliferation of models that share common parts, resulting in redundancies and inconsistencies. Meanwhile, modelling all variants together leads to less but more complex models, thus hindering on comprehensibility. This paper introduces a method for modelling families of process variants that addresses this trade-off. The key tenet of the method is to alternate between steps of decomposition (breaking down processes into sub-processes) and deciding which parts should be modelled together and which ones should be modelled separately. We have applied the method to two case studies: one concerning the consolidation of existing process models, and another dealing with green-field process discovery. In both cases, the method produced fewer models with respect to the baseline and reduced duplicity by up to 50{\%} without significant impact on complexity. },

  abstract = {Component based software engineering (CBSE) allows to design and develop reusable software components that can be assembled to construct software systems via well defined interfaces. However, designing such reusable components for data intensive business logic often requires heavy data transfer between components over interfaces. Static interface definitions using basic data types or structures of such lead to large interfaces susceptible to modifications. The goal of this paper is to present model-typed interfaces based on generic interface parameters, which allows to transfer complex structured data between components. Providing such generic, model-defined types (MDT) with data models specifying the parameter structure supports compatibility checks of model-typed interfaces at platform independent system design time. The methodology is described platform independently and the coherency with our system development process is discussed. Moreover, a technology mapping to IDL and the CORBA component model (CCM) is illustrated.},

Moreover, we demonstrate how the modes in behavior specification can be used for modeling behavior of an entire product line. The main benefits include (i) the existence of a single behavior specification capturing the behavior of all product variants, and (ii) automatic verification of absence of communication errors among the cooperating components taking the variability into account. These benefits are demonstrated on a part of a non-trivial case study. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Feature models incorporate the entire domain application configuration space, and are therefore developed collectively by teams of domain experts. In large scale industrial domains, feature models become too complex both in terms of maintenance and configuration. In order to make the maintenance and configuration of feature models feasible, we propose to modularize feature models based on the well-established Distributed Description Logics formalism. Modular feature models provide for an enhanced collaborative/ distributed feature model design, more efficient feature model evolution and better reusability of feature model structure. We also develop methods for the configuration and configuration verification of a modular feature model based on standard inference mechanisms.

This paper quantitatively analyzes the impact of this kind of use case modularization. We apply one specific technique, aspect oriented programming, to modularize the use case implementations of two information systems that conform to the layered architecture pattern. We extract traditional and contemporary metrics â including cohesion, coupling, and separation of concerns â to analyze modularity in terms of quality attributes such as changeability, support for independent development, and pluggability.

Variability can be described in terms of features, which are central for development and configuration of SPLs. In traditional SPLs, features are bound statically before runtime. By contrast, adaptive systems support feature binding at runtime and are sometimes called dynamic SPLs (DSPLs). DSPLs are usually built from coarse-grained components, which reduces the number of possible application scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we closely integrate static binding of traditional SPLs and runtime adaptation of DSPLs. We achieve this integration by statically generating a tailor-made DSPL from a highly customizable SPL. The generated DSPL provides only the runtime variability required by a particular application scenario and the execution environment. The DSPL supports self-configuration based on coarse-grained modules. We provide a feature-based adaptation mechanism that reduces the effort of computing an optimal configuration at runtime. In a case study, we demonstrate the practicability of our approach and show that a seamless integration of static binding and runtime adaptation reduces the complexity of the adaptation process. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

  abstract = {Maintenance of many variants of a software system, developed to supply a wide range of customer-specific demands, is a complex endeavour. The consolidation of such variants into a Software Product Line is a way to effectively cope with this problem. A crucial step for this consolidation is to reverse engineer feature models that represent the desired combinations of features of all the available variants. Many approaches have been proposed for this reverse engineering task but they present two shortcomings. First, they use a single-objective perspective that does not allow software engineers to consider design trade-offs. Second, they do not exploit knowledge from implementation artifacts. To address these limitations, our work takes a multi-objective perspective and uses knowledge from source code dependencies to obtain feature models that not only represent the desired feature combinations but that also check that those combinations are indeed well-formed, i.e. variability safe. We performed an evaluation of our approach with twelve case studies using NSGA-II and SPEA2, and a single-objective algorithm. Our results indicate that the performance of the multi-objective algorithms is similar in most cases and that both clearly outperform the single-objective algorithm. Our work also unveils several avenues for further research. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The order of test cases is determined by prioritization objectives such as covering code or critical components as rapidly as possible. The importance of this technique has been recognized in the context of Highly-Configurable Systems (HCSs), where the potentially huge number of configurations makes testing extremely challenging. However, current approaches for test case prioritization in {\{}HCSs{\}} suffer from two main limitations. First, the prioritization is usually driven by a single objective which neglects the potential benefits of combining multiple criteria to guide the detection of faults. Second, instead of using industry-strength case studies, evaluations are conducted using synthetic data, which provides no information about the effectiveness of different prioritization objectives. In this paper, we address both limitations by studying 63 combinations of up to three prioritization objectives in accelerating the detection of faults in the Drupal framework. Results show that nonâfunctional properties such as the number of changes in the features are more effective than functional metrics extracted from the configuration model. Results also suggest that multi-objective prioritization typically results in faster fault detection than mono-objective prioritization.},

Given the growing complexity of SPL development and the various stakeholders involved, their requirements are often specified from heterogeneous, partial views. However, existing requirements composition languages are very limited to generate specific requirements views for SPL products. They do not provide specialized composition rules for referencing and composing elements in recurring requirements models, such as use cases and activity models. This paper presents a multi-view composition language for SPL requirements, the Variability Modeling Language for Requirements (VML4RE). This language describes how requirements elements expressed in different models should be composed to generate a specific SPL product. The use of VML4RE is illustrated with UML-based requirements models defined for a home automation SPL case study. The language is evaluated with additional case studies from different application domains, such as mobile phones and sales management. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

In this paper we introduce the functionality of this add-in, which allows users to plot selected data in azimuthal projection, calculate and plot fold axes, construct density distribution diagrams and rose histograms, and create maps of spatial averages and fold axes. There is a link between projections and maps; therefore, it is possible to select point data in the projection and see their location on the map, and vice versa. Practical use of these tools is demonstrated in a case study of the Svratka and Poli{\v{c}}ka crystalline units (Eastern margin of the Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic), where a large dataset was collected. Using {\{}OATools{\}} the structural conditions were explored. Major changes in foliation dip directions were detected and the axial surfaces of the folds were determined.

Evolution implies the reuse and modification of existing software artifacts, and this means that the related knowledge must be documented and maintained. This paper focuses on the evolution of software product families, although the same principles apply in other software development environments as well. We describe our experience gained in a case study recovering a family of six software products. We give an overview of the case study, and provide lessons learned, implicit assumptions reconstructed during the case study, and some rules we think are generally applicable. Our experience indicates that organizing architectural knowledge is a difficult task. To properly serve the various uses of this knowledge, it needs to be organized along different dimensions and tools are required. Our experience also indicates that, next to variability explicitly designed into the product family, a "variation creep" is caused by different, and evolving, technical and organizational environments of the products. We propose explicitly modeling invariabilities, next to variabilities, in software product lines to get a better grip on this variation creep. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

Results Our results contain, but are not limited to, defining the phenomenon of obsolete software requirements, investigating how they are handled in industry today and their potential impact. Conclusion We conclude that obsolete software requirements constitute a significant challenge for companies developing software intensive products, in particular in large projects, and that companies rarely have processes for handling obsolete software requirements.

Various papers have been written on the application of DDS, however, there has been no attempt to systematically review and categorize the identified obstacles. Objective: The overall objective of this paper is to identify the state of the art of DDS, and describe the main lessons learned and obstacles in applying DDS. In addition, we aim to identify the important open research issues. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted by a multiphase study selection process using the published literature since the introduction of {\{}DDS{\}} in 2003. Results: We reviewed 468 papers that are discovered using a well-planned review protocol, and 34 of them were assessed as primary studies related to our research questions. Conclusions: We have identified 11 basic categories for describing the identified obstacles and the corresponding research challenges that can be used to depict the state-of-the-art in {\{}DDS{\}} and provide a vision for further research. },

  abstract = {Software architects typically spend a great deal of time and effort exploring uncertainties, evaluating alternatives, and balancing the concerns of stakeholders. Selecting the best architecture to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements is a critical but difficult task, especially at the early stage of software development when there may be many uncertainties. For example, how will a technology match the operational or performance expectations in reality? This paper presents an approach to building architecture-centric product line. The main objective of the proposed approach is to support effective requirements validation and architectural prototyping for the application-level software. Architectural prototyping is practically essential to architecture design and evaluation. However, architectural prototyping practiced in the field mostly is not used to explore alternatives. Effective construction and evaluation of multiple architecture alternatives is one of the critically challenging tasks. The product line architecture advocated in this paper consists of multiple software architecture alternatives, from which the architect can select and rapidly generate a working application prototype. The paper presents a case study of developing a framework that is primarily built with robust architecture patterns in distributed and concurrent computing and includes variation mechanisms to support various applications even in different domains. The development process of the framework is an application of software product line engineering with an aim to effectively facilitate upfront requirements analysis for an application and rapid architectural prototyping to explore and evaluate architecture alternatives. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London 2014.},

Recently, the use of search-based techniques have gained importance as they help the developers and project-managers in the identification of optimal solutions for developing effective prediction models. In this paper, we perform a systematic review of 78 primary studies from January 1992 to December 2015 which analyze the predictive capability of search-based techniques for ascertaining four predominant software quality attributes, i.e., effort, defect proneness, maintainability and change proneness. The review analyses the effective use and application of search-based techniques by evaluating appropriate specifications of fitness functions, parameter settings, validation methods, accounting for their stochastic natures and the evaluation of developmental models with the use of well-known statistical tests. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of different models, developed using the various search-based techniques amongst themselves, and also with the prevalent machine learning techniques used in literature. Although there are very few studies which use search-based techniques for predicting maintainability and change proneness, we found that the results of the application of search-based techniques for effort estimation and defect prediction are encouraging. Hence, this comprehensive study and the associated results will provide guidelines to practitioners and researchers and will enable them to make proper choices for applying the search-based techniques to their specific situations. },

It is not uncommon that these applications were not designed taking integration into account. Enterprise Application Integration provides methodologies and tools to design and implement integration solutions. Camel, Spring Integration, and Mule range amongst the most popular open-source tools that provide support to implement integration solutions. The adaptive maintenance of a software tool is very important for companies that need to reuse existing tools to build their own. We have analysed 25 maintainability measures on Camel, Spring Integration, and Mule. We have conducted a statistical analysis to confirm the results obtained with the maintainability measures, and it follows that these tools may have problems regarding maintenance. These problems increase the costs of the adaptation process. This motivated us to work on a new proposal that has been carefully designed in order to reduce maintainability efforts. Guaran{\'{a}}Â SDK is the software tool that we provide to implement integration solutions. We have also computed the maintainability measures regarding Guaran{\'{a}}Â SDK and the results suggest that maintaining it is easier than maintaining the others. Furthermore, we have conducted an industrial experience to demonstrate the application of our proposal in industry. },

Considering this problem, several approaches for feature location using execution traces have been developed. Nonetheless, the practice of post-mortem analysis based on execution traces is not fully incorporated in the daily practice of software maintainers. Empirical studies that reveal strengths and weaknesses on the use of execution traces in maintenance activities could better explain the role of execution traces in software maintenance. This study reports on a controlled experiment conducted with maintainers performing actual maintenance activities on systems of different sizes unknown to them. There are benefits from systematic use of execution traces: the reduction of the maintenance activity time and greater accuracy of the activity outcome. Other qualitative observations were the lower level of activity difficulty perceived by the participants that used execution trace information and that this kind of information seems to be less useful in maintenance activities where the problem of feature scattering does not occur clearly. },

  abstract = {Context: Maintainability has become one of the most essential attributes of software quality, as software maintenance has shown to be one of the most costly and time-consuming tasks of software development. Many studies reveal that maintainability is not often a major consideration in requirements and design stages, and software maintenance costs may be reduced by a more controlled design early in the software life cycle. Several problem factors have been identified as harmful for software maintainability, such as lack of upfront consideration of proper modularity choices. In that sense, the presence of crosscutting concerns is one of such modularity anomalies that possibly exert negative effects on software maintainability. However, to the date there is little or no knowledge about how characteristics of crosscutting concerns, observable in early artefacts, are correlated with maintainability. Objective: In this setting, this paper introduces an empirical analysis where the correlation between crosscutting properties and two ISO/IEC 9126 maintainability attributes, namely changeability and stability, is presented. Method: This correlation is based on the utilization of a set of concern metrics that allows the quantification of crosscutting, scattering and tangling. Results: Our study confirms that a change in a crosscutting concern is more difficult to be accomplished and that artefacts addressing crosscutting concerns are found to be less stable later as the system evolves. Moreover, our empirical analysis reveals that crosscutting properties introduce non-syntactic dependencies between software artefacts, thereby decreasing the quality of software in terms of changeability and stability as well. These subtle dependencies cannot be easily detected without the use of concern metrics. Conclusion: The correlation provides evidence that the presence of certain crosscutting properties negatively affects to changeability and stability. The whole analysis is performed using as target cases three software product lines, where maintainability properties are of upmost importance not only for individual products but also for the core architecture of the product line. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Different techniques can be used for reliability calculation or estimation. Some of these techniques are accurate but time-consuming while others are quick but not accurate. For example, using a set of mathematical equations for reliability estimation is very fast but not precise enough for large systems. Alternatively, Monte Carlo simulations are highly accurate, but very time-intensive. This work presents three different neural network models for estimating circuit reliability. The models provide better prediction accuracies than the mathematical technique. A reasonably large number of combinational circuits were simulated over a wide range of device reliabilities to collect the training data for the models. Multiple slices of an ISCAS-85 benchmark circuit were used to validate the models' prediction results. },

Method The research is based on an in-depth case study of two published mapping studies on software product line testing. Results We found that despite the fact that the two studies are addressing the same topic, there are quite a number of differences when it comes to papers included and in terms of classification of the papers included in the two mapping studies. Conclusions From this we conclude that although mapping studies are important, their reliability cannot simply be taken for granted. Based on the findings we also provide four conjectures that further research has to address to make secondary studies (systematic mapping studies and systematic literature reviews) even more valuable to both researchers and practitioners. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Moreover, quality assurance is complicated by service providers only giving information on their services in terms of domain specific concepts with only limited semantic meaning. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing service compositions based on pre-verified templates. Templates, given as workflow descriptions, are typed over a (domain-independent) template ontology defining concepts and predicates. Their meaning is defined by an abstract semantics, leaving the specific meaning of ontology concepts open, however, only up to given ontology rules. Templates are proven correct using a Hoare-style proof calculus, extended by a specific rule for service calls. Construction of service compositions amounts to instantiation of templates with domain-specific services. Correctness of an instantiation can then simply be checked by verifying that the domain ontology (a) adheres to the rules of the template ontology, and (b) fulfills the constraints of the employed template. },

Usually core assets and custom assets required by SPLS are built at the development time. However there are some software systems that need automatic and dynamic reconfiguration. To accommodate this, the SPL should have mechanisms to deal with it. Feature model is an important constituent of SPL. The feature model can represent similarities and variability's of software besides supporting quality product derivation. However, this model has drawbacks in usage for dynamic reconfiguration. Therefore it is essential to represent features using a different model for monitoring, retrieving and modifying automatically. Ontology is one such proven model that can formally represent well the features and their relationships in machine processable fashion. In the existing work, ontology was not implemented in the proposed frame work. The present work aims at implementing ontology based solution for automatic reconfiguration of SPL and product derivation. The empirical study with the improved prototype reveals that there is significant performance advantage when ontology is used for SPL configuration management. {\textcopyright} 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

  abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that have a particular set of common features and that satisfy the needs of a particular market segment or mission. Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g.; ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g.; add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In doing so, it offers new insights into the association between open innovation and diversification. We rely on arguments inspired by the literature and evidence collected through interviews with OSS SMEs' top managers to investigate factors that favor or hinder within-industry diversification. First, in line with the mainstream diversification literature, we focus attention on the role of firm size. Second, in the spirit of the open innovation research, we concentrate on the mechanisms that OSS SMEs put in place to get access to the external resources of the OSS community. Econometric evidence on 100 European OSS SMEs shows that firm size is negatively associated to within-industry diversification, while OSS SMEs that have contributed to a larger number of OSS projects have a more diversified portfolio of software products. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that the practice of authorizing firm programmers to contribute autonomously to OSS projects of their own choice during working hours may be positively associated to within-industry diversification only if OSS SMEs possess adequate internal technological resources.},

  abstract = {Context: Open source software (OSS) and software ecosystems (SECOs) are two consolidated research areas in software engineering. OSS influences the way organizations develop, acquire, use and commercialize software. SECOs have emerged as a paradigm to understand dynamics and heterogeneity in collaborative software development. For this reason, SECOs appear as a valid instrument to analyze OSS systems. However, there are few studies that blend both topics together. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of the art in OSS ecosystems (OSSECOs) research, specifically: (a) what the most relevant definitions related to OSSECOs are; (b) what the particularities of this type of SECO are; and (c) how the knowledge about OSSECO is represented. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping following recommended practices. We applied automatic and manual searches on different sources and used a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the final papers. As a result, 82 papers were selected and evaluated. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible. Results: The analysis allowed us to answer the research questions. Most notably, we did the following: (a) identified 64 terms related to the OSSECO and arranged them into a taxonomy; (b) built a genealogical tree to understand the genesis of the OSSECO term from related definitions; (c) analyzed the available definitions of SECO in the context of OSS; and (d) classified the existing modelling and analysis techniques of OSSECOs. Conclusion: As a summary of the systematic mapping, we conclude that existing research on several topics related to OSSECOs is still scarce (e.g., modelling and analysis techniques, quality models, standard definitions, etc.). This situation calls for further investigation efforts on how organizations and OSS communities actually understand OSSECOs.},

It contributes to improve modularity, stability and to reduce feature tangling and scattering. Improvements can also be obtained with a search based and multi-objective approach, such as MOA4PLA, which generates PLAs with the best trade-off between different measures, such as cohesion, coupling and feature modularization. However, MOA4PLA operators may violate the aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) rules, impacting negatively on the architecture understanding. In order to solve this problem, this paper introduces a more adequate representation for AOPLAs and a set of search operators, called SO4ASPAR (Search Operators for Aspect-Oriented Architectures). Results from an empirical evaluation show that the proposed operators yield better solutions regarding the fitness values, besides preserving the AOM rules. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

This challenges the configuration and customization of cloud-based software that are typically offered as a service due to the intrinsic variability. In this paper, we present a model-driven approach based on variability models originating from the software product line community to handle such multi-dimensional variability in the cloud. We exploit orthogonal variability models to systematically manage and create tenant-specific configuration and customizations. We also demonstrate how such variability models can be utilized to take into account the already deployed application parts to enable harmonized deployments for new tenants in a multi-cloud setting. The approach considers application functional and non-functional requirements to provide a set of valid multi-cloud configurations.

  abstract = {As distributed systems become more complex, understanding the underlying algorithms that make these systems work becomes even harder. Traditional learning modalities based on didactic teaching and theoretical proofs alone are no longer sufficient for a holistic understanding of these algorithms. Instead, an environment that promotes an immersive, hands-on learning of distributed systems algorithms is needed to complement existing teaching modalities. Such an environment must be flexible to support the learning of a variety of algorithms. The environment should also support extensibility and reuse since many of these algorithms share several common traits with each other while differing only in some aspects. Finally, it must also allow students to experiment with large-scale deployments in a variety of operating environments. To address these concerns, we use the principles of software product lines and model-driven engineering, and adopt the cloud platform to design an immersive learning environment called the Playground of Algorithms for Distributed Systems (PADS). A prototype implementation of PADS is described to showcase use cases involving BitTorrent Peer-to-Peer file sharing, ZooKeeper-based coordination, and Paxos-based consensus, which show the benefits of rapid deployment of the distributed systems algorithms.

  abstract = {Pattern mining of cloned codes in software systems is a challenging task due to various modifications and the large size of software codes. Most existing approaches adopt a token-based software representation and use sequential analysis for pattern mining of cloned codes. Due to the intrinsic limitations of such spatial space analysis, these methods have difficulties handling statement reordering, insertion and control replacement. Recently, graph-based models such as program dependent graph have been exploited to solve these issues. Although they can improve the performance in terms of accuracy, they introduce additional problems. Their computational complexity is very high and dramatically increases with the software size, thus limiting their applications in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern mining framework for cloned codes in software systems. It efficiently exploits software's spatial space information as well as graph space information and thus can mine accurate patterns of cloned codes for software systems. Preliminary experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with other methods. },

The goal is to study purposeful performance variability in software product lines, in particular, the motivation to vary performance, and the strategy for realizing performance variability in the product line architecture. The research method was a theory-building case study that was augmented with a systematic literature review. The case was a mobile network base station product line with capacity variability. The data collection, analysis and theorizing were conducted in several stages: the initial case study results were augmented with accounts from the literature. We constructed three theoretical models to explain and characterize performance variability in software product lines: the models aim to be generalizable beyond the single case. The results describe capacity variability in a base station product line. Thereafter, theoretical models of performance variability in software product lines in general are proposed. Performance variability is motivated by customer needs and characteristics, by trade-offs and by varying operating environment constraints. Performance variability can be realized by hardware or software means; moreover, the software can either realize performance differences in an emergent way through impacts from other variability or by utilizing purposeful varying design tactics. The results point out two differences compared with the prevailing literature. Firstly, when the customer needs and characteristics enable price differentiation, performance may be varied even with no trade-offs or production cost differences involved. Secondly, due to the dominance of feature modeling, the literature focuses on the impact management realization. However, performance variability can be realized through purposeful design tactics to downgrade the available software resources and by having more efficient hardware. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Nevertheless there have been only few lifecycle models that attempt to portray such evolution. We use the evolution of the Linux kernel as the basis for the formulation of such a model, integrating the progress in time with growth of the codebase, and differentiating between development of new functionality and maintenance of production versions. A unique element of the model is the sequence of activities involved in releasing new production versions, and how this has changed with the growth of Linux. In particular, the release follow-up phase before the forking of a new development version, which was prominent in early releases of production versions, has been eliminated in favor of a concurrent merge window in the release of 2.6.x versions. We also show that a piecewise linear model with increasing slopes provides the best description of the growth of Linux. The perpetual development model is used as a framework in which commonly recognized benefits of incremental and evolutionary development may be demonstrated, and to comment on issues such as architecture, conservation of familiarity, and failed projects. We suggest that this model and variants thereof may apply to many other projects in addition to Linux. },

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate and assess the ability of explanatory models based on design metrics to describe and predict defect counts in an object-oriented software system. Specifically, we empirically evaluate the influence of design decisions to defect behavior of the classes in two products from the commercial software domain. Information provided by these models can help in resource allocation and serve as a base for assessment and future improvements. We use innovative statistical methods to deal with the peculiarities of the software engineering data, such as non-normally distributed count data. To deal with overdispersed data and excess of zeroes in the dependent variable, we use negative binomial (NB) and zero-inflated {\{}NB{\}} regression in addition to Poisson regression. Furthermore, we form a framework for comparison of models' descriptive and predictive ability. Predictive capability of the models to identify most critical classes in the system early in the software development process can help in allocation of resources and foster software quality improvement. In addition to the correlation coefficients, we use additional statistics to assess a models' ability to explain high variability in the data and Pareto analysis to assess a models' ability to identify the most critical classes in the system. Results indicate that design aspects related to communication between classes and inheritance can be used as indicators of the most defect-prone classes, which require the majority of resources in development and testing phases. The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model, designed to explicitly model the occurrence of zero counts in the dataset, provides the best results for this purpose. },

  abstract = {Abstract Context: Testing highly-configurable software systems is challenging due to a large number of test configurations that have to be carefully selected in order to reduce the testing effort as much as possible, while maintaining high software quality. Finding the smallest set of valid test configurations that ensure sufficient coverage of the system's feature interactions is thus the objective of validation engineers, especially when the execution of test configurations is costly or time-consuming. However, this problem is NP-hard in general and approximation algorithms have often been used to address it in practice. Objective: In this paper, we explore an alternative exact approach based on constraint programming that will allow engineers to increase the effectiveness of configuration testing while keeping the number of configurations as low as possible. Method: Our approach consists in using a (time-aware) minimization algorithm based on constraint programming. Given the amount of time, our solution generates a minimized set of valid test configurations that ensure coverage of all pairs of feature values (a.k.a. pairwise coverage). The approach has been implemented in a tool called PACOGEN. Results: {\{}PACOGEN{\}} was evaluated on 224 feature models in comparison with the two existing tools that are based on a greedy algorithm. For 79{\%} of 224 feature models, {\{}PACOGEN{\}} generated up to 60{\%} fewer test configurations than the competitor tools. We further evaluated {\{}PACOGEN{\}} in the case study of an industrial video conferencing product line with a feature model of 169 features, and found 60{\%} fewer configurations compared with the manual approach followed by test engineers. The set of test configurations generated by {\{}PACOGEN{\}} decreased the time required by test engineers in manual test configuration by 85{\%}, increasing the feature-pairs coverage at the same time. Conclusion: Our experimental evaluation concluded that optimal time-aware minimization of pairwise-covering test configurations is efficiently addressed using constraint programming techniques. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Previous work by researchers on 3 years of early data for an Eclipse product has identified some predictors of failure-prone files that work well. Eclipse has also been used previously by researchers to study characteristics of product line software. Objective The work reported here investigates whether classification-based prediction of failure-prone files improves as the product line evolves. Method This investigation first repeats, to the extent possible, the previous study and then extends it by including four more recent years of data, comparing the prominent predictors with the previous results. The research then looks at the data for three additional Eclipse products as they evolve over time. The analysis compares results from three different types of datasets with alternative data collection and prediction periods. Results Our experiments with a variety of learners show that the difference between the performance of J48, used in this work, and the other top learners is not statistically significant. Furthermore, new results show that the effectiveness of classification significantly depends on the data collection period and prediction period. The study identifies change metrics that are prominent predictors across all four releases of all four products in the product line for the three different types of datasets. From the product line perspective, prediction of failure-prone files for the four products studied in the Eclipse product line shows statistically significant improvement in accuracy but not in recall across releases. Conclusion As the product line matures, the learner performance improves significantly for two of the three datasets, but not for prediction of post-release failure-prone files using only pre-release change data. This suggests that it may be difficult to detect failure-prone files in the evolving product line. At least in part, this may be due to the continuous change, even for commonalities and high-reuse variation components, which we previously have shown to exist. },

  abstract = {{\{}XSLT{\}} is a popular language for implementing both presentation templates in Web applications as well as document and message converters in enterprise applications. The widespread adoption and popularity of {\{}XSLT{\}} raises the challenge of efficiently managing the evolution of significant amounts of {\{}XSLT{\}} code. This challenge calls for guidelines and tool support for developing maintainable {\{}XSLT{\}} code. In this setting, this paper addresses the following question: Can the maintainability of {\{}XSL{\}} transformations, measured in terms of code churn in the next revision of a transformation, be predicted using a combination of simple metrics? This question is studied using a dataset extracted from open-source software project repositories. An outcome of this empirical study is a set of statistical models for predicting the maintainability of {\{}XSL{\}} transformations with relatively high accuracy. In addition, by analyzing the major influencers of code churn in these models, the paper identifies guidelines for designing {\{}XSL{\}} transformations with reduced future churn. },

Various kinds of processes also exist, and each of them relates to different kinds of artifacts. Traceability over them has thus large diversity. In addition, developers in each process have different types of purposes to improve their artifacts and process. Research results in traceability have to be categorized and analyzed so that such a developer can choose one of them to achieve his/her purposes. In this paper, we report on the results of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) related to software and systems traceability. Our SLR is preliminary one because we only analyzed articles in ACM digital library and IEEE computer society digital library. We found several interesting trends in traceability research. For example, researches related to creating or maintaining traceability are larger than those related to using it or thinking its strategy. Various kinds of traceability purposes are addressed or assumed in many researches, but some researches do not specify purposes. Purposes related to changes and updates are dominant.},

  abstract = {Almost every sufficiently complex software system today is configurable. Conditional compilation is a simple variability-implementation mechanism that is widely used in open-source projects and industry. Especially, the C preprocessor (CPP) is very popular in practice, but it is also gaining (again) interest in academia. Although there have been several attempts to understand and improve CPP, there is a lack of understanding of how it is used in open-source and industrial systems and whether different usage patterns have emerged. The background is that much research on configurable systems and product lines concentrates on open-source systems, simply because they are available for study in the first place. This leads to the potentially problematic situation that it is unclear whether the results obtained from these studies are transferable to industrial systems. We aim at lowering this gap by comparing the use of CPP in open-source projects and industryâespecially from the embedded-systems domainâbased on a substantial set of subject systems and well-known variability metrics, including size, scattering, and tangling metrics. A key result of our empirical study is that, regarding almost all aspects we studied, the analyzed open-source systems and the considered embedded systems from industry are similar regarding most metrics, including systems that have been developed in industry and made open source at some point. So, our study indicates that, regarding CPP as variability-implementation mechanism, insights, methods, and tools developed based on studies of open-source systems are transferable to industrial systemsâat least, with respect to the metrics we considered. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Architectural styles help to improve the Product Line Architecture (PLA) design by providing a better organization of its elements, which results in some benefits, like flexibility, extensibility and maintainability. The PLA design can also be improved by using a search based optimization approach, taking into account different metrics, such as cohesion, coupling and feature modularization. However, the application of search operators changes the PLA organization, and consequently may violate the architectural styles rules, impacting negatively in the architecture understanding. To overcome such limitation, this work introduces a set of search operators to be used in the search based design with the goal of preserving the architectural styles during the optimization process. Such operators consider rules of the layered and client/server architectural styles, generally used in the search based design of conventional architectures and PLAs. The operators are implemented and evaluated in the context of MOA4PLA, a Multi-objective Optimization Approach for PLA Design. Results from an empirical evaluation show that the proposed operators contribute to obtain better solutions, preserving the adopted style and also improving some software metric values. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Context Today, software and embedded systems act as enablers for developing new functionality in traditional industries such as the automotive, process automation, and manufacturing automation domains. This differs from 25â30 years ago when these systems where based on electronics and electro-mechanical solutions. The architecture of the embedded system and of the software is important to ensure the qualities of these applications. However, the effort of designing and evolving the architecture is in practice often neglected during system development, whilst development efforts are centered on implementing new functionality. Objective We present problems and success factors that are central to the architectural development of software intensive systems in the domain of automotive and automation products as judged by practitioners. Method The method consisted of three steps. First, we used semi-structured interviews to collect data in an exploratory manner. As a second step, a survey based on problems extracted from the interview data was used to investigate the occurrence of these problems at a wider range of organizations. In order to identify and suggest how to mitigate the problems that were considered important, we finally performed root cause analysis workshops, and from these a number of success factors were elicited. Results A total of 21 problems have been identified based on the interview data, and these are related to the technical, organizational, project, and agreement processes. Based on the survey results, the following four problems were selected for a root cause analysis: (1) there is a lack of process for architecture development, (2) there is a lack of method or model to evaluate the business value when choosing the architecture, (3) there is a lack of clear long-term architectural strategy, and (4) processes and methods are less valued than knowledge and competence of individuals. Conclusion In conclusion, the following identified success factors are crucial components to be successful in developing software intensive systems: (1) define an architectural strategy, (2) implement a process for architectural work, (3) ensure authority for architects, (4) clarify the business impact of the architecture, and (5) optimize on the project portfolio level instead of optimizing each project. },

Teams that develop software using these models are guided by defined, detailed processes. However, an increasing number of teams have been implementing agile software development methods that focus on people rather than processes. What, then, is maturity for these agile teams that focus less on detailed, defined processes? This is the question we sought to answer in this study. To this end, we asked agile practitioners about their perception of the maturity level of a number of practices and how they defined maturity in agile software development. We used cluster analysis to analyze quantitative data and triangulated the results with content analysis of the qualitative data. We then proposed a new definition for agile software development maturity. The findings show that practitioners do not see maturity in agile software development as process definition or quantitative management capabilities. Rather, agile maturity means fostering more subjective capabilities, such as collaboration, communication, commitment, care, sharing and self-organization. },

  abstract  = {Context: The process of constructing a product from a product line of software assets is known product derivation. An effective product derivation process is important in order to ensure that the efforts required to develop these shared assets is lower than the benefits achieved through their use. Despite its importance, relatively little work has been dedicated to the product derivation process and the strategies applied in practice. Additionally, there is a lack of empirical reports describing product derivation in industrial settings, and, in general, where these reports are available, they have been conducted as informal studies. Objective: Our aim is to investigate how product derivation is performed in practice. Method: We apply a multi-case study design to two different industrial software product line projects with the goal of investigating how they derive their products in practice. The findings from our studies were individually analyzed using the Constant Comparison technique. In order to identify patterns across these studies, the findings were compared using a Cross-case analysis approach. Results: The research approach allowed us to examine the case study outcomes from different perspectives, capturing similarities and differences. From the cases, we identified context specific strategies for product derivation which are easier for practitioners to contextualise and implement. Conclusions: The case studies provide method-in-action insights into concepts explored in the literature, such as: iterative and incremental product derivation, instantiation and integration of platform components and derivation of product databases. Practitioners can use this work as a basis for defining, adapting or evaluating their own product derivation approaches. While researchers can use this work as a starting point for new industrial reports, presenting their experiences with product derivation.},

  abstract = {The growth of the Web has fueled the creation, storage, and exchange of digital information products (DIPs), whose main purpose is the delivery of information, entertainment, education, or training. Very often, after their initial creation, the growing amount of content also leads to a more complicated maintenance, since updates typically occur rather often and the potential variability of modifications is not limited in advance. Moreover, commonalities between different parts of similar information products are not exploited, which often leads to redundancy. At the moment, there is hardly any attempt to compose information products from different sources and to produce more complex information products in a coordinated way. To help remedy this situation, this paper introduces the Product Lines for digitAl iNformation producTs (PLANT) approach, which applies the concept of software product lines to DIPs. The {\{}PLANT{\}} approach explicitly manages the commonalities of similar {\{}DIPs{\}} by defining common requirements, limiting variability in advance, as well as planning and coordinating reuse. This article focuses on the modeling of such product lines. In particular, the developed general concepts will be exemplified throughout the paper in the area of e-learning, in which {\{}DIPs{\}} play an important role. The application of {\{}PLANT{\}} in other areas and an implemented tool that supports the creation of information products in a product line are outlined as well. },

These models differ in their underlying structure prescribing different possible paths to maturity in agile software development, neglecting the fact that agile teams struggle to follow prescribed processes and practices. Our objective, therefore, was to empirically investigate how agile teams evolve to maturity, as a means to conceive a theory for agile software development evolvement that considers agile teams nature. The complex adaptive systems theory was used as a lens for analysis and four case studies were conducted to collect qualitative and quantitative data. As a result, we propose the Progressive Outcomes framework to describe the agile software development maturing process. It is a framework in which people have the central role, ambidexterity is a key ability to maturity, and improvement is guided by outcomes agile teams pursue, instead of prescribed practices. },

Consequently, a common business process is often captured in multiple models that overlap in content due to serving different purposes. Business process management aims at flexible adaptation to changing business needs. Hence, changes of business processes occur frequently and have to be incorporated in the respective process models. Once a process model is changed, related process models have to be updated accordingly, despite the fact that those process models may only be loosely coupled. In this article, we introduce an approach that supports change propagation between related process models. Given a change in one process model, we leverage the behavioural abstraction of behavioural profiles for corresponding activities in order to determine a change region in another model. Our approach is able to cope with changes in pairs of models that are not related by hierarchical refinement and show behavioural inconsistencies. We evaluate the applicability of our approach with two real-world process model collections. To this end, we either deduce change operations from different model revisions or rely on synthetic change operations. },

In this work, we prototype a Smart Hotel DSPL to evaluate the reliability-based risk of the DSPL reconfigurations, specifically, the probability of malfunctioning (Availability) and the consequences of malfunctioning (Severity). This DSPL prototype was performed with the participation of human subjects by means of a Smart Hotel case study which was deployed with real devices. Moreover, we successfully identified and addressed two challenges associated with the involvement of human subjects in DSPL prototyping: enabling participants to (1) trigger the run-time reconfigurations and to (2) understand the effects of the reconfigurations. The evaluation of the case study reveals positive results regarding both Availability and Severity. However, the participant feedback highlights issues with recovering from a failed reconfiguration or a reconfiguration triggered by mistake. To address these issues, we discuss some guidelines learned in the case study. Finally, although the results achieved by the DSPL may be considered satisfactory for its particular domain, DSPL engineers must provide users with more control over the reconfigurations or the users will not be comfortable with DSPLs.},

  abstract = {Abstract Testing systems with many variables and/or values is often quite expensive due to the huge number of possible combinations to be tested. There are several criteria available to combine test data and produce scalable test suites. One of them is pairwise. With the pairwise criterion, each pair of values of any two parameters is included in at least one test case. Although this is a widely-used coverage criterion, two main characteristics improve considerably pairwise: constraints handling and prioritisation. This paper presents an algorithm and a tool. The algorithm (called PROW: Pairwise with constRaints, Order and Weight) handles constraints and prioritisation for pairwise coverage. The tool called {\{}CTWeb{\}} adds functionalities to execute {\{}PROW{\}} in different contexts, one of them is product sampling in Software Product Lines via importing feature models. Software Product Line (SPL) development is a recent paradigm, where a family of software systems is constructed by means of the reuse of a set of common functionalities and some variable functionalities. An essential artefact of a {\{}SPL{\}} is the feature model, which shows the features offered by the product line, jointly with the relationships (includes and excludes) among them. Pairwise testing could be used to obtain the product sampling to test in a SPL, using features as pairwise parameters. In this context, the constraint handling becomes essential. As a difference with respect to other tools, {\{}CTWeb{\}} does not require {\{}SAT{\}} solvers. This paper describes the {\{}PROW{\}} algorithm, also analysing its complexity and efficiency. The {\{}CTWeb{\}} tool is presented, including two examples of the {\{}PROW{\}} application to two real environments: the first corresponds to the migration of the subsystem of transactions processing of a credit card management system from {\{}AS400{\}} to Oracle with .NET; the second applies both the algorithm and the tool to a {\{}SPL{\}} that monitors and controls some parameters of the load in trucks. },

We survey relevant literature within software engineering for problems in which qualitative optimization techniques can be useful. We also present a model of optimization that relies on the stakeholders qualitative preferences leveraging recent advances in decision theoretic artificial intelligence, which could prove useful and spawn connections between qualitative decision theory and software engineering. },

However, it is not clear what the implications are on software quality when moving from a traditional approach to an ecosystem, and this is becoming increasingly important as ecosystems emerge in critical domains such as embedded applications. Therefore, this paper investigates the challenges related to quality assurance in software ecosystems, and identifies what approaches have been proposed in the literature. The research method used is a systematic literature mapping, which however only resulted in a small set of six papers. The literature findings are complemented with a constructive approach where areas are identified that merit further research, resulting in a set of research topics that form a research agenda for quality assurance in software ecosystems. The agenda spans the entire system life-cycle, and focuses on challenges particular to an ecosystem setting, which are mainly the results of the interactions across organizational borders, and the dynamic system integration being controlled by the users. },

  abstract = {In software product line engineering, the customers mostly concentrate on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration. The quality attributes of a target product, such as security and performance, are often assessed until the final product is generated. However, it might be very costly to fix the problem if it is found that the generated product cannot satisfy the customers' quality requirements. Although the quality of a generated product will be affected by all the life cycles of product development, feature-based product configuration is the first stage where the estimation or prediction of the quality attributes should be considered. As we know, the key issue of predicting the quality attributes for a product configured from feature models is to measure the interdependencies between functional features and quality attributes. The current existing approaches have several limitations on this issue, such as requiring real products for the measurement or involving domain experts' efforts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a systematic approach of modeling quality attributes in feature models based on domain experts' judgments using the analytic hierarchical process (AHP) and conducting quality aware product configuration based on the captured quality knowledge. Domain experts' judgments are adapted to avoid generating the real products for quality evaluation, and AHP is used to reduce domain experts' efforts involved in the judgments. A prototype tool is developed to implement the concepts of the proposed approach, and a formal evaluation is carried out based on a large-scale case study. {\textcopyright} 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

As a consequence of the increasing number of Web services on the Internet and its important role in many applications today, Web service quality has become a crucial requirement and demanded by service consumers. Terms of quality levels are written between service providers and service consumers to ensure a degree of quality. The use of monitoring tools to control service quality levels is very important. Quality attributes suffer variations in their values during runtime, this is produced by many factors such as a memory leak, deadlock, race data, inconsistent data, etc. However, sometimes monitoring tools can impact negatively affecting the quality of service when they are not properly used and configured, producing possible conflicts between quality attributes. This paper aims to show the impact of monitoring tools over service quality, two of the most important quality attributes â performance and accuracy â were chosen to be monitored. A case study is conducted to present and evaluate the relationship between performance and accuracy over a Web service. As a result, conflict is found between performance and accuracy, where performance was the most affected, because it presented a degradation in its quality level during monitoring.},

This representative portfolio stems from a much larger portfolio of {\{}IT{\}} projects. We calculated the volatility from the function point countings that were available to us. These figures were aggregated into a requirements volatility benchmark. We found that maximum requirements volatility rates depend on size and duration, which refutes currently known industrial averages. For instance, a monthly growth rate of 5{\%} is considered a critical failure factor, but in our low-risk portfolio we found more than 21{\%} of successful projects with a volatility larger than 5{\%}. We proposed a mathematical model taking size and duration into account that provides a maximum healthy volatility rate that is more in line with the reality of low-risk {\{}IT{\}} portfolios. Based on the model, we proposed a tolerance factor expressing the maximal volatility tolerance for a project or portfolio. For a low-risk portfolio its empirically found tolerance is apparently acceptable, and values exceeding this tolerance are used to trigger {\{}IT{\}} decision makers. We derived two volatility ratios from this model, the $\pi$ -ratio and the $\rho$ -ratio. These ratios express how close the volatility of a project has approached the danger zone when requirements volatility reaches a critical failure rate. The volatility data of a governmental {\{}IT{\}} portfolio were juxtaposed to our bancassurance benchmark, immediately exposing a problematic project, which was corroborated by its actual failure. When function points are less common, e.g.Â in the embedded industry, we used daily source code size measures and illustrated how to govern the volatility of a software product line of a hardware manufacturer. With the three real-world portfolios we illustrated that our results serve the purpose of an early warning system for projects that are bound to fail due to excessive volatility. Moreover, we developed essential requirements volatility metrics that belong on an {\{}IT{\}} governance dashboard and presented such a volatility dashboard. },

  abstract = {A key idea of feature orientation is to decompose a software product line along the features it provides. Feature decomposition is orthogonal to object-oriented decompositionâit crosscuts the underlying package and class structure. It has been argued often that feature decomposition improves system structure by reducing coupling and by increasing cohesion. However, recent empirical findings suggest that this is not necessarily the case. In this exploratory, observational study, we investigate the decompositions of 28 feature-oriented software product lines into classes, features, and feature-specific class fragments. The product lines under investigation are implemented using the feature-oriented programming language Fuji. In particular, we quantify and compare the internal attributes import coupling and cohesion of the different product-line decompositions in a systematic, reproducible manner. For this purpose, we adopt three established software measures (e.g., coupling between units, CBU; internal-ratio unit dependency, IUD) as well as standard concentration statistics (e.g., Gini coefficient). In our study, we found that feature decomposition can be associated with higher levels of structural coupling in a product line than a decomposition into classes. Although coupling can be concentrated in very few features in most feature decompositions, there are not necessarily hot-spot features in all product lines. Interestingly, feature cohesion is not necessarily higher than class cohesion, whereas features are more equal in serving dependencies internally than classes of a product line. Our empirical study raises critical questions about alleged advantages of feature decomposition. At the same time, we demonstrate how our measurement approach of coupling and cohesion has potential to support static and dynamic analyses of software product lines (i.e., type checking and feature-interaction detection) by facilitating product sampling. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We grouped the most important patterns in seven categories and highlighted them separately. These patterns relate to the five fundamental parameters for IT-governance: data, control, time, cost and functionality. We revealed patterns of overperfect and heterogeneous data signifying reporting anomalies or ambiguous IT-governance rules, respectively. We also detected patterns of overregulation and underregulation, portending bloated control or no IT-control at all, both with negative side-effects: productivity loss, and too costly IT-development. Uniform management on time, cost or functionality showed clear patterns in the time and cost case, and more diffuse combined patterns for functionality. For these in total seven types of patterns, it was possible to take corrective measures to reduce unwanted side-effects, and/or amplify the intended purpose of the underlying IT-governance rules. These modifications ranged from refinements and additions, to eradications of IT-governance rules. For each of the seven patterns we provided lessons learned and recommendations on how to recognize and remove unwanted effects. Some effects were dangerous, and addressing them led to significant risk reduction and cost savings. },

  abstract = {Abstract A domain-specific language (DSL) aims to support software development by offering abstractions to a particular domain. It is expected that {\{}DSLs{\}} improve the maintainability of artifacts otherwise produced with general-purpose languages. However, the maintainability of the {\{}DSL{\}} artifacts and, hence, their adoption in mainstream development, is largely dependent on the usability of the language itself. Unfortunately, it is often hard to identify their usability strengths and weaknesses early, as there is no guidance on how to objectively reveal them. Usability is a multi-faceted quality characteristic, which is challenging to quantify beforehand by {\{}DSL{\}} stakeholders. There is even less support on how to quantitatively evaluate the usability of {\{}DSLs{\}} used in maintenance tasks. In this context, this paper reports a study to compare the usability of textual {\{}DSLs{\}} under the perspective of software maintenance. A usability measurement framework was developed based on the cognitive dimensions of notations. The framework was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using two {\{}DSLs{\}} in the context of two evolving object-oriented systems. The results suggested that the proposed metrics were useful: (1) to early identify {\{}DSL{\}} usability limitations, (2) to reveal specific {\{}DSL{\}} features favoring maintenance tasks, and (3) to successfully analyze eight critical {\{}DSL{\}} usability dimensions. },

  abstract = {During the last couple of decades, feature modeling tools have played a significant role in the improvement of software productivity and quality by assisting tasks in software product line (SPL). SPL decomposes a large-scale software system in terms of their functionalities. The goal of the decomposition is to create well-structured individual software systems that can meet different users' requirements. Thus, feature modeling tools provides means to manage the inter-dependencies among reusable common and variable functionalities, called features. There are several tools to support variability management by modeling features in SPL. The variety of tools in the current literature makes it difficult to understand what kinds of tasks are supported and how much effort can be reduced by using these tools. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study aiming to support SPL engineers choosing the feature modeling tool that best fits their needs. This empirical study compares and analyzes three tools, namely SPLOT, FeatureIDE, and pure::variants. These tools are analyzed based on data from 119 participants. Each participant used one tool for typical feature modeling tasks, such as create a model, update a model, automated analysis of the model, and product configuration. Finally, analysis concerning the perceived ease of use, usefulness, effectiveness, and efficiency are presented. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

These dependencies and constraints describe the possible number of variants of the program: A valid feature configuration generates a specific variant with unique behavior. Feature-Oriented Programming is used to implement features as program units. This paper introduces rbFeatures, a feature-oriented programming language implemented on top of the dynamic programming language Ruby. With rbFeatures, programmers use software product lines, variants, and features as first-class entities. This allows several runtime reflection and modification capabilities, including the extension of the product line with new features and the provision of multiple variants. The paper gives a broad overview to the implementation and application of rbFeatures. We explain how features as first-class entities are designed and implemented, and discuss how the semantics of features are carefully added to Ruby programs. We show two case studies: The expression product line, a common example in feature-oriented programming, and a web application. },

However, software reuse has an associated steep learning curve, since practitioners must become familiar with a third party rationale for representing and implementing reusable assets. For this reason, enabling a systematic approach to the reuse process by making software reuse tasks explicit, allowing software frameworks to be instantiated using pre-defined primitive and complex reuse operations, and supporting the reuse process in a (semi-)automated way become crucial goals. In this paper, we present a systematic reuse approach and the Reuse Description Language (RDL), a language designed to specify object-oriented framework instantiation processes, and an RDL execution environment, which is the tool support for definition and execution of reuse processes and framework instantiations that lead to domain-specific applications. We illustrate our approach using DTFrame, a framework for creating drawing editors.},

  abstract = {Context: The current situation and future scenarios of the automotive domain require a new strategy to develop high quality software in a fast pace. In the automotive domain, it is assumed that a combination of agile development practices and software product lines is beneficial, in order to be capable to handle high frequency of improvements. This assumption is based on the understanding that agile methods introduce more flexibility in short development intervals. Software product lines help to manage the high amount of variants and to improve quality by reuse of software for long term development. Goal: This study derives a better understanding of the expected benefits for a combination. Furthermore, it identifies the automotive specific challenges that prevent the adoption of agile methods within the software product line. Method: Survey based on 16 semi-structured interviews from the automotive domain, an internal workshop with 40 participants and a discussion round on ESE congress 2016. The results are analyzed by means of thematic coding. Results: Two main expected benefits of merging agile practices and product line development are pushing the change in software development for future proof agile automotive organizations. Challenges that prevent agile adoption within software product lines are mainly of organizational, technical and social nature. Key challenges are related to transforming organizational structures and culture, achieving faster software release cycles without loss of quality, appropriate quality assurance measures for software variants, and the collaboration with suppliers and other disciplines such as mechanics. Conclusion: Significant challenges are imposed by specific characteristics of the automotive domain such as high quality requirements and many interfaces to surrounding rigid and inflexible processes. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  abstract = {Features define common and variable parts of the members of a (software) product line. Feature models are used to specify the set of all valid feature combinations. Feature models not only enjoy an intuitive tree-like graphical syntax, but also a precise formal semantics, which can be denoted as propositional formulae over Boolean feature variables. A product line usually constitutes a long-term investment and, therefore, has to undergo continuous evolution to meet ever-changing requirements. First of all, product-line evolution leads to changes of the feature model due to its central role in the product-line paradigm. As a result, product-line engineers are often faced with the problems that (1) feature models are changed in an ad-hoc manner without proper documentation, and (2) the semantic impact of feature diagram changes is unclear. In this article, we propose a comprehensive approach to tackle both challenges. For (1), our approach compares the old and new version of the diagram representation of a feature model and specifies the changes using complex edit operations on feature diagrams. In this way, feature model changes are automatically detected and formally documented. For (2), we propose an approach for reasoning about the semantic impact of diagram changes. We present a set of edit operations on feature diagrams, where complex operations are primarily derived from evolution scenarios observed in a real-world case study, i.e., a product line from the automation engineering domain. We evaluated our approach to demonstrate its applicability with respect to the case study, as well as its scalability concerning experimental data sets. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {AbstractContext Socio-technical systems are expected to understand the dynamics of the execution environment and behave accordingly. Significant work has been done on formalizing and modeling requirements of such adaptive systems. However, not enough attention is paid on eliciting requirements from users and introducing flexibility in the system behavior at an early phase of requirements engineering. Most of the work is based on an assumption that general users' cognitive level would be able to support the inherent complexity of variability acquisition. Objective Our main focus is on providing help to the users with ordinary cognitive level to express their expectations from the complex system considering various contexts. This work also helps the designers to explore the design variability based on the general users' preferences. Method We explore the idea of using a cognitive technique Repertory Grid (RG) to acquire knowledge from users and experts along multiple dimensions of problem and design space. We propose {\{}REASSURE{\}} methodology which guides requirements engineers to explore the intentional and design variability in an organized way. We also provide a tool support to analyze the knowledge captured in multiple repertory grid files and detect potential conflicts in the intentional variability. Finally, we evaluate the proposed idea by performing an empirical study using smart home system domain. Results The result of our study shows that a greater number of requirements can be elicited after applying our approach. With the help of the provided tool support, it is even possible to detect a greater number of conflicts in user's requirements than the traditional practices. Conclusion We envision {\{}RG{\}} as a technique to filter design options based on the intentional variability in various contexts. The promising results of empirical study open up new research questions: âhow to elicit requirements from multiple stakeholders and reach consensus for multi-dimensional problem domainâ. },

Design/methodology/approach An automated quasi-systematic review identified 42 papers, which were then analyzed. Findings The main findings are: there exist distinct â organization, group and process â levels of reconciliation; few studies deal with reconciliation among the three models of development; a significant amount of work addresses reconciliation between plan-driven and agile development; several large organizations (such as Microsoft, Motorola, and Philips) are interested in trying to combine these models; and reconciliation among software development models is still an open issue, since it is an emerging area and research on most proposals is at an early stage. Research limitations Automated searches may not capture relevant papers in publications that are not indexed. Other data sources not amenable to execution of the protocol were not used. Data extraction was performed by only one researcher, which may increase the risk of threats to internal validity. Implications This characterization is important for practitioners wanting to be current with the state of research. This review will also assist the scientific community working with software development processes to build a common understanding of the challenges that must be faced, and to identify areas where research is lacking. Finally, the results will be useful to software industry that is calling for solutions in this area. Originality/value There is no other systematic review on this subject, and reconciliation among software development models is an emerging area. This study helps to identify and consolidate the work done so far and to guide future research. The conclusions are an important step towards expanding the body of knowledge in the field. },

  abstract = {{\{}IT{\}} has become a production means for many organizations and an important element of business strategy. Even though its effective management is a must, reality shows that this area still remains in its infancy. {\{}IT{\}} management relies profoundly on relevant information which enables risk mitigation or cost control. However, the needed information is either missing or its gathering boils down to daunting tasks. We propose an approach to recovery of management information from the essence of IT; the software's source code. In this paper we show how to employ source code analysis techniques and recover management information. In our approach we exploit the potential of the concealed data which resides in the source code statements, source comments, and also compiler listings. We show how to depart from the raw sources, extract data, organize it, and eventually utilize so that the bit level data provides {\{}IT{\}} executives with support at the portfolio level. Our approach is pragmatic as we rely on real management questions, best practices in software engineering, and also {\{}IT{\}} market specifics. We enable, for instance, an assessment of the IT-portfolio market value, support for carrying out what-if scenarios, or identification and evaluation of the hidden risks for IT-portfolio maintainability. The study is based on a real-life IT-portfolio which supports business functions of an organization operating in the financial sector. The IT-portfolio comprises Cobol applications run on a mainframe with the total number of lines of code amounting to over 18 million.

  abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) aims at applying a pre-planned systematic reuse of large-grained software artifacts to increase the software productivity and reduce the development cost. The idea of SPLE is to analyze the business domain of a family of products to identify the common and the variable parts between the products. However, it is common for companies to develop, in an ad-hoc manner (e.g. clone and own), a set of products that share common services and differ in terms of others. Thus, many recent research contributions are proposed to re-engineer existing product variants to a software product line. These contributions are mostly focused on managing the variability at the requirement level. Very few contributions address the variability at the architectural level despite its major importance. Starting from this observation, we propose an approach to reverse engineer the architecture of a set of product variants. Our goal is to identify the variability and dependencies among architectural-element variants. Our work relies on formal concept analysis to analyze the variability. To validate the proposed approach, we evaluated on two families of open-source product variants; Mobile Media and Health Watcher. The results of precision and recall metrics of the recovered architectural variability and dependencies are 81{\%}, 91{\%}, 67{\%} and 100{\%}, respectively.},

  abstract = {There is an intimate link between program structure and behaviour. Exploiting this link to phrase program correctness problems in terms of the structural properties of a program graph rather than in terms of its unfoldings is a useful strategy for making analyses more tractable. The present paper presents a characterisation of behavioural program properties through sets of structural properties by means of a translation. The characterisation is given in the context of a program model based on control flow graphs of sequential programs with procedures, abstracting away completely from program data, and properties expressed in a fragment of the modal $\mu$ -calculus with boxes and greatest fixed-points only. The property translation is based on a tableau construction that conceptually amounts to symbolic execution of the behavioural formula, collecting structural constraints along the way. By keeping track of the subformulae that have been examined, recursion in the structural constraints can be identified and captured by fixed-point formulae. The tableau construction terminates, and the characterisation is exact, i.e., the translation is sound and complete. A prototype implementation has been developed. In addition, we show how the translation can be extended beyond the basic flow graph model and safety logic to richer behavioural models (such as open programs) and richer program models (including Boolean programs), and discuss possible extensions for more complex logics. We present several applications of the characterisation, in particular sound and complete compositional verification for behavioural properties based on maximal models. },

Component based approaches play an important role in development of product lines: Components represent features, and different component combinations lead to different products. The number of combinations is exponential in the number of features, which makes the cost of product line model checking high. In this paper, we propose two techniques to reduce the number of component combinations that have to be verified. The first technique is using the static slicing approach to eliminate the features that do not affect the property. The second technique is analyzing the property and extracting sufficient conditions of property satisfaction/violation, to identify products that satisfy or violate the property without model checking. We apply these techniques on a vending machine case study to show the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. The results show that the number of generated states and time of model checking is reduced significantly using the proposed reduction techniques. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Software product lines are intended to be used in a long period of time. As a result, they evolve over time, due to the changes in the requirements.

In this paper we aim to decrease this cost by reducing the number of verified products using static analysis techniques. Furthermore, to reduce model checking costs after product line evolution, we restrict the number of products that should be re-verified by reusing the previous verification result. All proposed techniques are based on static analysis of the product family model with respect to the property and can be automated.

Rarely SPLs start from scratch, instead they usually start from a set of existing systems that undergo a reengineering process. Many approaches to conduct the reengineering process have been proposed and documented in research literature. This scenario is a clear testament to the interest in this research area. We conducted a systematic mapping study to provide an overview of the current research on reengineering of existing systems to SPLs, identify the community activity in regarding of venues and frequency of publications in this field, and point out trends and open issues that could serve as references for future research. This study identified 119 relevant publications. These primary sources were classified in six different dimensions related to reengineering phases, strategies applied, types of systems used in the evaluation, input artefacts, output artefacts, and tool support. The analysis of the results points out the existence of a consolidate community on this topic and a wide range of strategies to deal with different phases and tasks of the reengineering process, besides the availability of some tools. We identify some open issues and areas for future research such as the implementation of automation and tool support, the use of different sources of information, need for improvements in the feature management, the definition of ways to combine different strategies and methods, lack of sophisticated refactoring, need for new metrics and measures and more robust empirical evaluation.

  abstract      = {Product lines are a promising approach to improve conceptually the productivity of the software development process and thus to reduce both the cost and time of developing and maintaining increasingly complex systems. An important issue in the adoption of the product-line approach is the migration of legacy software components, which have not been designed for reuse, systematically into reusable product-line components. This article describes activities performed to improve systematically the design and implementation of an existing software component in order to reuse it in a software product line. The activities are embedded in the application of Fraunhofer PuLSEâ¢-DSSA - an approach for defining domain-specific software architectures (DSSA) and product-line architectures. The component under investigation is the so-called Image Memory Handler (IMH), which is used in Ricoh's current products of office appliances such as copier machines, printers, and multi-functional peripherals. It is responsible for controlling memory usage and compressing and decompressing image data. Improvement of both the component's design and implementation are based on a systematic analysis and focused on increasing maintainability and reusability and hence suitability for use in a product line. As a result of the analysis and refactoring activities, the documentation and implementation of the component has been considerably improved as shown by quantitative data collected at the end of the activities. Despite a number of changes to the code, the external behavior of the component has been preserved without significantly affecting the performance.

  abstract = {It has been advocated that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is an effective technique to improve software maintainability through explicit support for modularising crosscutting concerns. However, in order to take the advantages of AOP, there is a need for supporting the systematic refactoring of crosscutting concerns to aspects. Existing techniques for aspect-oriented refactoring are too fine-grained and do not take the concern structure into consideration. This paper presents two categories towards a metaphor-based classification of crosscutting concerns driven by their manifested shapes through a system's modular structure. The proposed categories provide an intuitive and fundamental terminology for detecting concern-oriented design flaws and identifying refactorings in terms of recurring crosscutting structures. On top of this classification, we define a suite of metaphor-based refactorings to guide the âaspectisationâ of each concern category. We evaluate our technique by classifying concerns of 23 design patterns and by proposing refactorings to aspectise them according to observations made in previous empirical studies. Based on our experience, we also determine a catalogue of potential additional categories and heuristics for refactoring of crosscutting concerns. },

  abstract = {Abstract Many software-intensive systems today can be characterized as systems of systems (SoS) comprising complex, interrelated, and heterogeneous systems. The behavior of SoS often only emerges at runtime due to complex interactions between the involved systems and their environment. It is thus necessary to determine unexpected behavior by monitoring SoS at runtime, i.e., collecting and analyzing events and data at different layers and levels of granularity. Existing monitoring approaches are often limited to individual systems, particular architectural styles, or technologies. In this paper we thus derive challenges for monitoring SoS based on an industrial case. We present a flexible framework adaptable to different system architectures and technologies. We discuss its capabilities for instrumenting systems, collecting and persisting events and data, checking constraints on events and data, and visualizing the systems' behavior to users. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility by tailoring and applying it to an industrial SoS and assessing its performance and scalability. Our results show that the framework is flexible and scalable for monitoring an industrial SoS with realistic event loads. },

However, the complex relations between features and their implementations are not evident from the source code of object-oriented Java programs. Consequently, the implementations of individual features are difficult to locate, comprehend, and modify in isolation. In this paper, we present a novel remodularization approach that improves the representation of features in the source code of Java programs. Both forward and reverse restructurings are supported through on-demand bidirectional restructuring between feature-oriented and object-oriented decompositions. The approach includes a feature location phase based on tracing of program execution, a feature representation phase that reallocates classes into a new package structure based on single-feature and multi-feature packages, and an annotation-based reverse transformation of code. Case studies performed on two open-source projects indicate that our approach requires relatively little manual effort and reduces tangling and scattering of feature implementations in the source code. },

However, noticeable variations in processes start to emerge as precise details are added to process definitions. While each such variation gives rise to a different process, these processes might more usefully be considered as variants of each other, rather than completely different processes. This paper proposes that it is beneficial to regard such an appropriately close set of process variants as a process family. The paper suggests a characterization of what might comprise a process family and introduces a formal approach to defining families based upon this characterization. To illustrate this approach, we describe a case study that demonstrates the different variations we observed in processes that define how dispute resolution is performed at the U.S. National Mediation Board. We demonstrate how our approach supports the definition of this set of process variants as a process family. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  abstract = {Abstract CONTEXT. Software Product Lines (SPLs) aim to support the development of a whole family of software products through systematic reuse of shared assets. As {\{}SPLs{\}} exhibit a long life-span, evolution is an even greater concern than for single-systems. For the purpose of this work, evolution refers to the adaptation of the {\{}SPL{\}} as a result of changing requirements. Hence, evolution is triggered by requirement changes, and not by bug fixing or refactoring. OBJECTIVE. Research on {\{}SPL{\}} evolution has not been previously mapped. This work provides a mapping study along Petersen's and Kichenham's guidelines, to identify strong areas of knowledge, trends and gaps. RESULTS. We identified 107 relevant contributions. They were classified according to four facets: evolution activity (e.g., identify, analyze and plan, implement), product-derivation approach (e.g., annotation-based, composition-based), research type (e.g., solution, experience, evaluation), and asset type (i.e., variability model, {\{}SPL{\}} architecture, code assets and products). CONCLUSION. Analyses of the results indicate that âSolution proposalsâ are the most common type of contribution (31{\%}). Regarding the evolution activity, âImplement changeâ (43{\%}) and âAnalyze and plan changeâ (37{\%}) are the most covered ones. A finer-grained analysis uncovered some tasks as being underexposed. A detailed description of the 107 papers is also included. },

Fundamentals of variability management and product lines have been available in the software engineering research field for several decades. Nevertheless, projects to cope with variability in practice tend to fall short of target. The reason for this gap between sound theories and poor practice, common in multiple software engineering subfields, remains unclear. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted in a large-scale software dependent multinational. The results of this case study show a number of factors that impact successful variability practice. These factors can be abstracted into general hypotheses useful for bridging the gap between theory and practice.

  abstract = {Context: Software product lines (SPLs) have reached a considerable level of adoption in the software industry, having demonstrated their cost-effectiveness for developing higher quality products with lower costs. For this reason, in the last years the requirements engineering community has devoted much effort to the development of a myriad of requirements modelling languages for SPLs. Objective: In this paper, we review and synthesize the current state of research of requirements modelling languages used in SPLs with respect to their degree of empirical validation, origin and context of use, level of expressiveness, maturity, and industry adoption. Method: We have conducted a systematic literature review with six research questions that cover the main objective. It includes 54 studies, published from 2000 to 2013. Results: The mean level of maturity of the modelling languages is 2.59 over 5, with 46{\%} of them falling within level 2 or below -no implemented abstract syntax reported-. They show a level of expressiveness of 0.7 over 1.0. Some constructs (feature, mandatory, optional, alternative, exclude and require) are present in all the languages, while others (cardinality, attribute, constraint and label) are less common. Only 6{\%} of the languages have been empirically validated, 41{\%} report some kind of industry adoption and 71{\%} of the languages are independent from any development process. Last but not least, 57{\%} of the languages have been proposed by the academia, while 43{\%} have been the result of a joint effort between academia and industry. Conclusions: Research on requirements modeling languages for SPLs has generated a myriad of languages that differ in the set of constructs provided to express SPL requirements. Their general lack of empirical validation and adoption in industry, together with their differences in maturity, draws the picture of a discipline that still needs to evolve. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The initial investment costs for a production plant are enormous â in many cases up to 100 Mio. â¬, and the entire life-cycle is up to 30 years. In order to preserve existing investments and to retain the competitiveness of the production plant it continuously has to be developed and improved further. In consequence, basic modules (software, electric, and/or mechanic) as well as application modules (product line based combination of basic modules) have to be upgraded during the entire life cycle of the automation system in cooperation of plant owner and module supplier. Therefore two essential topics have to be considered: a) an integrated variant- and version management of basic modules, application modules based on product lines, and modules, which are part of production plants in the field and b) an interdisciplinary compatibility supervision technique to validate the compatibility of new module versions with respect to the various application contexts and the complex dependencies between software (software design), platform (electrical design) and/or context (mechanical design). Both challenges can only be resolved with an appropriate tool support for variant and version management of modular models and for model validation to supervise the interdisciplinary compatibility. To provide this tool support a syntactic and semantic formal model is necessary. In this paper the requirements on a holistic mathematical modeling of evolution in automation engineering are proposed.},

In practice though, implementing a variability management approach remains a tough case-by-case challenge for any organization. To tame the complexity of this undertaking, it is inevitable to handle variability from multiple perspectives and to manage variability consistently across artifacts, tools, and workflows. Especially, a solid understanding and management of the requirements to be met by the products is an inevitable prerequisite. In this article, we share experiences from the ongoing incremental adoption of explicit variability management at TRW Automotive's department for automotive slip control systemsâlocated in Koblenz, Germany. On the technical side, the three key drivers of this adoption effort are (a) domain modeling and scoping, (b) handling of variability in requirements and (c) tighter integration of software engineering focus areas (e.g., domain modeling, requirements engineering, architectural modeling) to make use of variability-related data. In addition to implementation challenges with using and integrating concrete third-party tools, social and workflow-related issues are covered as well. The lessons learned are presented, discussed, and thoroughly compared with the state of the art in research. {\textcopyright} 2013, Springer-Verlag London.},

This article envisages several strategies for resourceâusageâaware configuration which feature different performance and efficiency trade-offs.

Domain engineering approaches are widely used in the software engineering. They focus on building reusable models in a domain. At the Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering (IAS) of the University of Stuttgart, a new domain engineering approach has been developed. The approach considers entire industrial automation systems, including hardware and software. Models that capture structure and behavior of entire systems have to be carefully tailored, in order to be reusable. The level of granularity deserves particular attention, since too coarse or too fine grained reusable models discourage reuse. This paper addresses the issue of finding appropriate levels of granularity and proposes a set of recommendations for determining appropriate levels of granularity for reusable models created during domain engineering.},

We analyze our experience and discuss the benefits and limitations of each technique supported by our MBUID environment. The system architecture, the structure and composition of UI elements and the models specification languages have a decisive impact on reusability. In our case, more than 40{\%} of the elements defined in the UI specifications were reused, resulting in a reduction of 55{\%} of the specification size. Inclusion, parametrization and sub-specification have facilitated modularity and internal reuse of UI specifications at development time, whereas the reuse of UI elements between applications has greatly benefited from sharing repositories of UI elements at run time.},

  abstract = {Abstract The use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) has become a successful technique to develop complex systems. In this context, an emerging phenomenon is the existence of {\{}DSL{\}} variants, which are different versions of a {\{}DSL{\}} adapted to specific purposes but that still share commonalities. In such a case, the challenge for language designers is to reuse, as much as possible, previously defined language constructs to narrow implementation from scratch. To overcome this challenge, recent research in software languages engineering introduced the notion of language product lines. Similarly to software product lines, language product lines are often built from a set of existing {\{}DSL{\}} variants. In this article, we propose a reverse-engineering technique to ease-off such a development scenario. Our approach receives a set of {\{}DSL{\}} variants which are used to automatically recover a language modular design and to synthesize the corresponding variability models. The validation is performed in a project involving industrial partners that required three different variants of a {\{}DSL{\}} for finite state machines. This validation shows that our approach is able to correctly identify commonalities and variability. },

  abstract = {Product lines are an important system development paradigm in the automotive industry to amortize costs beyond a single product. The paradigm is well established in the mechanical and electrical engineering practice in automotive companies like Bosch. As software is covering more and more functionality in cars, software product lines are getting more attention. The architecture of a software-intensive system is a key asset in developing a software product line. The Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) developed by the SEI assesses the quality of software architecture early in the development process. ATAM is therefore a useful review technique to guarantee important quality attributes of every single product created with the product line architecture later on. This article reports about the experience Bosch made in using ATAM in two cases. Benefits in using ATAM are not only the review results itself but a better documented and better understood architecture. We experienced the most important benefit of ATAM is the rising stakeholders' awareness of architectural decisions, tradeoffs, and risks. It illuminates the software architecture better than any written documentation. Bosch employees are trained in the evaluation roles in order to transition ATAM to Bosch. The reports conclude with some suggestions for improving the ATAM itself and the training of ATAM roles. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

In total, we analyze 231 papers from 2007 until 2014 and provide an overview of the research in software ecosystems. Our analysis reveals a field that is rapidly growing, both in volume and empirical focus, while becoming more mature. We identify signs of field maturity from the increase in: (i) the number of journal articles, (ii) the empirical models within the last two years, and (iii) the number of ecosystems studied. However, we note that the field is far from mature and identify a set of challenges that are preventing the field from evolving. We propose means for future research and the community to address them. Finally, our analysis shapes the view of the field having evolved outside the existing definitions of software ecosystems and thus propose the update of the definition of software ecosystems. },

However, establishing a SPL is not a simple matter, and can affect all aspects of the organization, since the approach is complex and involves major investment and considerable risk. These risks can have a negative impact on the expected ROI for an organization, if SPL is not sufficiently managed. This paper presents a mapping study of Risk Management (RM) in SPL Engineering. We analyzed a set of thirty studies in the field. The results points out the need for risk management practices in SPL, due to the little research on RM practices in SPL and the importance of identifying insight on RM in SPL. Most studies simply mention the importance of RM, however the steps for managing risk are not clearly specified. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given, through the use of industrial case studies and experiments, to improve SPL productivity and ensure its success. This research is a first attempt within the SPL community to identify, classify, and manage risks, and establish mitigation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

In order to accommodate the user frequently changing demands for different network applications, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) traditionally purchases and operates new dedicated network equipment, which always incurs high capital expense (CAPEX) and operating expense (OPEX) from the economic viewpoint and also burdens network management. Inspired by the ideas of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), we consider dealing with the above challenge by reusing virtualized network functions and selecting appropriate ones to compose the customized routing services on the routing paths for different applications. In this paper, based on SDN and NFV, we propose Routing as a Service (RaaS) as an open framework to customize the specific routing services for applications. Then, we present Routing Service Product Line (RSPL) by introducing Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) into the proposed RaaS, so as to rapidly customize a large number of routing services with different characteristics. In addition, according to the proposed framework, we also carry out a case study to customizing routing services with benefits of both the user and the ISP considered. Simulation results show that the proposed RaaS is feasible and efficient. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Abstract Software product lines enable generating related software products from reusable assets. Adopting a product line strategy can bring significant quality and productivity improvements. However, evolving a product line can be risky, since it might impact many products. When introducing new features or improving its design, it is important to make sure that the behavior of existing products is not affected. To ensure that, one usually has to analyze different types of artifacts, an activity that can lead to errors. To address this issue, in this work we discover and analyze concrete evolution scenarios from five different product lines. We discover a total of 13 safe evolution templates, which are generic transformations that developers can apply when evolving compositional and annotative product lines, with the goal of preserving the behavior of existing products. We also evaluate the templates by analyzing the evolution history of these product lines. In this evaluation, we observe that the templates can address the modifications that developers performed in the analyzed scenarios, which corroborates the expressiveness of our template set. We also observe that the templates could also have helped to avoid the errors that we identified during our analysis. },

  abstract = {Most methodologies for the design and analysis of mechatronic systems target a single product. From a business perspective, successful product development requires shortening development times, reducing engineering costs and offering a greater variety of product options for customers. In software engineering, the software product line (SPL) technology has been developed to meet these conflicting goals, and several major companies have reported success stories resulting from SPL adoption. In mechanical engineering, similar methodologies have been developed under the name of product platforms. Methodologies for analyzing product qualities such as safety or reliability have been introduced for both SPL and product platforms. The problem with these methodologies is that they consider either software or mechanical product design, so they do not guide developers to find the best balance between the controller and the equipment to be controlled. Several system properties of a mechatronic product line should be investigated with mechatronic analysis methodologies before the development process branches to software, electronic and mechanical design. In particular, safety is one system property that can only be analyzed by considering both the equipment and its controller, so mechatronic methodologies early in the design are advantageous for discovering safety-related design constraints before costly design commitments are made. This paper extends the Functional Failure Identification and Propagation (FFIP) framework to the safety analysis of a mechatronic product line with options in software signal connections and equipment. The result of applying FFIP is that unsafe combinations of options are removed from the product line.},

  abstract = {Migrating legacy systems or deploying a new application to a cloud environment has recently become very trendy, because the number of cloud providers available is still increasing. These cloud environments provide a wide range of resources at different levels of functionality, which must be appropriately configured by stakeholders for the application to run properly. Handling this variability during the configuration and deployment stages is known as a complex and error-prone process, usually made in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we propose SALOON, a software product lines-based platform to face these issues. We describe the architecture of the SALOON platform, which relies on feature models combined with a domain model used to select among cloud environments a well-suited one. SALOON supports stakeholders while configuring the selected cloud environment in a consistent way and automates the deployment of such configurations through the generation of executable configuration scripts. This paper also reports on some experiments, showing that using SALOON significantly reduces time to configure a cloud environment compared with a manual approach and provides a reliable way to find a correct and suitable configuration. Moreover, our empirical evaluation shows that our approach is effective and scalable to properly deal with a significant number of cloud environments. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Context: A software product line is a family of related software products, typically created from a set of common assets. Users select features to derive a product that fulfills their needs. Users often expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, such as a small footprint or a bounded response time. Because a product line may have an exponential number of products with respect to its features, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product. Objective: Our overall goal is to derive optimal products with respect to non-functional requirements by showing customers which features must be selected. Method: We propose an approach to predict a product's non-functional properties based on the product's feature selection. We aggregate the influence of each selected feature on a non-functional property to predict a product's properties. We generate and measure a small set of products and, by comparing measurements, we approximate each feature's influence on the non-functional property in question. As a research method, we conducted controlled experiments and evaluated prediction accuracy for the non-functional properties footprint and main-memory consumption. But, in principle, our approach is applicable for all quantifiable non-functional properties. Results: With nine software product lines, we demonstrate that our approach predicts the footprint with an average accuracy of 94{\%}, and an accuracy of over 99{\%} on average if feature interactions are known. In a further series of experiments, we predicted main memory consumption of six customizable programs and achieved an accuracy of 89{\%} on average. Conclusion: Our experiments suggest that, with only few measurements, it is possible to accurately predict non-functional properties of products of a product line. Furthermore, we show how already little domain knowledge can improve predictions and discuss trade-offs between accuracy and required number of measurements. With this technique, we provide a basis for many reasoning and product-derivation approaches. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The most common fitness function utilized maximizes the number of matched products with an oracle set of products. However, to calculate this fitness each product defined by the chromosome has to be enumerated using a SAT solver and this limits scalability to product lines with fewer than 30 features. In this paper we propose SATff, a fitness function that simulates validity by computing the difference between constraints in the chromosome and oracle. In an empirical study on 101 feature models comparing SATff with two existing fitness functions that use the enumeration technique we find that SATff shows a significant improvement over one, and no significant difference with the other one. We also find that SATff requires only 7{\%} of the runtime on average scaling to feature models with as many as 97 features. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

However, isolation between the various components is limited. A faulty version of any one of the software components can compromise the whole system by consuming all available resources. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently identifying faulty software components running simultaneously in a single virtual machine. Current solutions that perform permanent and extensive monitoring to detect anomalies induce high overhead on the system, and can, by themselves, make the system unstable. In this paper we present an optimistic adaptive monitoring system to determine the faulty components of an application. Suspected components are finely analyzed by the monitoring system, but only when required. Unsuspected components are left untouched and execute normally. Thus, we perform localized just-in-time monitoring that decreases the accumulated overhead of the monitoring system. We evaluate our approach on two case studies against a state-of-the-art monitoring system and show that our technique correctly detects faulty components, while reducing overhead by an average of 93{\%}. },

Faced with the complexity of analysis pipelines, the large number of computational tools, and the enormous amount of data to manage, there is compelling evidence that many if not most scientific discoveries will not stand the test of time: increasing the reproducibility of computed results is of paramount importance. The objective we set out in this paper is to place scientific workflows in the context of reproducibility. To do so, we define several kinds of reproducibility that can be reached when scientific workflows are used to perform experiments. We characterize and define the criteria that need to be catered for by reproducibility-friendly scientific workflow systems, and use such criteria to place several representative and widely used workflow systems and companion tools within such a framework. We also discuss the remaining challenges posed by reproducible scientific workflows in the life sciences. Our study was guided by three use cases from the life science domain involving in silico experiments. },

  abstract = {Abstract Context: Software library reuse has significantly increased the productivity of software developers, reduced time-to-market and improved software quality and reusability. However, with the growing number of reusable software libraries in code repositories, finding and adopting a relevant software library becomes a fastidious and complex task for developers. Objective: In this paper, we propose a novel approach called LibFinder to prevent missed reuse opportunities during software maintenance and evolution. The goal is to provide a decision support for developers to easily find âusefulâ third-party libraries to the implementation of their software systems. Method: To this end, we used the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), a multi-objective search-based algorithm, to find a trade-off between three objectives : 1) maximizing co-usage between a candidate library and the actual libraries used by a given system, 2) maximizing the semantic similarity between a candidate library and the source code of the system, and 3) minimizing the number of recommended libraries. Results: We evaluated our approach on 6083 different libraries from Maven Central super repository that were used by 32,760 client systems obtained from Github super repository. Our results show that our approach outperforms three other existing search techniques and a state-of-the art approach, not based on heuristic search, and succeeds in recommending useful libraries at an accuracy score of 92{\%}, precision of 51{\%} and recall of 68{\%}, while finding the best trade-off between the three considered objectives. Furthermore, we evaluate the usefulness of our approach in practice through an empirical study on two industrial Java systems with developers. Results show that the top 10 recommended libraries was rated by the original developers with an average of 3.25 out of 5. Conclusion: This study suggests that (1) library usage history collected from different client systems and (2) library semantics/content embodied in library identifiers should be balanced together for an efficient library recommendation technique. },

  abstract = {Context The correct analysis and understanding of security requirements are important because they assist in the discovery of any security or requirement defects or mistakes during the early stages of development. Security requirements engineering is therefore both a central task and a critical success factor in product line development owing to the complexity and extensive nature of software product lines (SPL). However, most of the current {\{}SPL{\}} practices in requirements engineering do not adequately address security requirements engineering. Objective The aim of this approach is to describe a holistic security requirements engineering framework with which to facilitate the development of secure {\{}SPLs{\}} and their derived products. It will conform with the most relevant security standards with regard to the management of security requirements, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 15408. Results This framework is composed of: a security requirements engineering process for {\{}SPL{\}} (SREPPLine) driven by security standards; a Security Reference Meta Model to manage the variability of those {\{}SPL{\}} artefacts related to security requirements; and a tool (SREPPLineTool) which implements the meta-model and supports the process. Method A complete explanation of the framework will be provided. The process will be formally specified with {\{}SPEM{\}} 2.0 and the repository will be formally specified with an {\{}XML{\}} grammar. The application of {\{}SREPPLine{\}} and {\{}SREPPLineTool{\}} will be illustrated through a description of a simple example as a preliminary validation. Conclusion Although there have been several attempts to fill the gap between requirements engineering and {\{}SPL{\}} requirements engineering, no systematic approach with which to define security quality requirements and to manage their variability and their related security artefacts in {\{}SPL{\}} models is, as yet, available. The contribution of this work is that of providing a systematic approach for the management of the security requirements and their variability from the early stages of product line development in order to facilitate the conformance of {\{}SPL{\}} products with the most relevant security standards. },

Additionally, IRM-SA allows for architecture self-adaptation at runtime and integrates the mechanism of predictive monitoring that deals with operational uncertainty. As a proof of concept, it was implemented in DEECo, a component framework that is based on dynamic ensembles of components. Furthermore, its feasibility was evaluated in experimental settings assuming decentralized system operation. },

Hence, applications for these systems require support for self-adaptation to the continual context changes. Most of the approaches for self-adaptive systems implement a reconfiguration service that receives as input the list of all possible configurations and the plans to switch between them. In this paper we present an alternative approach for the automatic generation of application configurations and the reconfiguration plans at runtime. With our approach, the generated configurations are optimal as regards different criteria, such as functionality or resource consumption (e.g. battery or memory). This is achieved by: (1) modelling architectural variability at design-time using the Common Variability Language (CVL), and (2) using a genetic algorithm that finds nearly-optimal configurations at run-time using the information provided by the variability model. We also specify a case study and we use it to evaluate our approach, showing that it is efficient and suitable for devices with scarce resources. },

In principle, a controller at runtime can monitor the change impact on quality requirements of the system, update the expectations and priorities from the environment, and take reasonable actions to improve the overall satisfaction. In practice, however, existing controllers are mostly designed for tuning low-level performance indicators instead of high-level requirements. By maintaining a live goal model to represent runtime requirements and linking the overall satisfaction of quality requirements to an indicator of earned business value, we propose a control-theoretic self-tuning method that can dynamically tune the preferences of different quality requirements, and can autonomously make tradeoff decisions through our Preference-Based Goal Reasoning procedure. The reasoning procedure results in an optimal configuration of the variation points by selecting the right alternative of OR-decomposed goals and such a configuration is mapped onto corresponding system architecture reconfigurations. The effectiveness of our self-tuning method is evaluated by earned business value, comparing our results with those obtained using static and ad hoc methods. },

Our approach provides concepts and tool support for the semi-automatic abstraction of architecture component and connector views from implemented systems and keeping the abstracted architecture models up-to-date during software evolution. In particular, we propose architecture abstraction concepts that are supported through a domain-specific language (DSL). Our main focus is on providing architectural abstraction specifications in the {\{}DSL{\}} that only need to be changed, if the architecture changes, but can tolerate non-architectural changes in the underlying source code. Once the software architect has defined an architectural abstraction in the DSL, we can automatically generate architectural component views from the source code using model-driven development (MDD) techniques and check whether architectural design constraints are fulfilled by these models. Our approach supports the automatic generation of traceability links between source code elements and architectural abstractions using {\{}MDD{\}} techniques to enable software architects to easily link between components and the source code elements that realize them. It enables software architects to compare different versions of the generated architectural component view with each other. We evaluate our research results by studying the evolution of architectural abstractions in different consecutive versions of five open source systems and by analyzing the performance of our approach in these cases. },

  abstract = {Abstract One of the important problems in High Level Architecture (HLA) based distributed simulation systems is the allocation of the different simulation modules to the available physical resources. Usually, the deployment of the simulation modules to the physical resources can be done in many different ways, and each deployment alternative will have a different impact on the performance. Although different algorithmic solutions have been provided to optimize the allocation with respect to the performance, the problem has not been explicitly tackled from an architecture design perspective. Moreover, for optimizing the deployment of the simulation system, tool support is largely missing. In this paper we propose a method for automatically deriving deployment alternatives for {\{}HLA{\}} based distributed simulation systems. The method extends the {\{}IEEE{\}} Recommended Practice for High Level Architecture Federation Development and Execution Process by providing an approach for optimizing the allocation at the design level. The method is realized by the tool framework, S-IDE (Simulation-IDE) that we have developed to provide an integrated development environment for deriving a feasible deployment alternative based on the simulation system and the available physical resources at the design phase. The method and the tool support have been validated using a case study for the development of a traffic simulation system. },

Since it is critical that enforced policies are correct, policy testing must be performed in an effective way to identify potential security flaws and bugs. In practice, exhaustive testing is impossible due to budget constraints. Therefore the tests need to be prioritized so that resources are focused on their most relevant subset. Objective This paper tackles the issue of access control test prioritization. It proposes a new approach for access control test prioritization that relies on similarity. Method The approach has been applied to several policies and the results have been compared to random prioritization (as a baseline). To assess the different prioritization criteria, we use mutation analysis and compute the mutation scores reached by each criterion. This helps assessing the rate of fault detection. Results The empirical results indicate that our proposed approach is effective and its rate of fault detection is higher than that of random prioritization. Conclusion We conclude that prioritization of access control test cases can be usefully based on similarity criteria. },

  abstract = {Context
Integrated control systems (ICSs) are heterogeneous systems where software and hardware components are integrated to control and monitor physical devices and processes. A family of ICSs share the same software code base, which is configured differently for each product to form a unique installation. Due to the complexity of ICSs and inadequate automation support, product configuration in this context is typically error-prone and costly.
Objective
As a first step to overcome these challenges, we propose a UML-based product-line modeling methodology that provides a foundation for semi-automated product configuration in the specific context of ICSs.
Method
We performed a comprehensive domain analysis to identify characteristics of ICS families, and their configuration challenges. Based on this, we formulated the characteristics of an adequate configuration solution, and derived from them a set of modeling requirements for a model-based solution to configuration. The SimPL methodology is proposed to fulfill these requirements.
Results
To evaluate the ability of SimPL to fulfill the modeling requirements, we applied it to a large-scale industrial case study. Our experience with the case study shows that SimPL is adequate to provide a model of the product family that meets the modeling requirements. Further evaluation is still required to assess the applicability and scalability of SimPL in practice. Doing this requires conducting field studies with human subjects and is left for future work.
Conclusion
We conclude that configuration in ICSs requires better automation support, and UML-based approaches to product family modeling can be tailored to provide the required foundation.},

  abstract = {Product or service concepts based on emerging technologies are usually results of research projects, be they performed by academic groups or by research departments of companies. Many times, the prototypes or demonstrators that result from such projects are supposed to evolve into commercial products or services, but â at least in the first stage - there are more focus on proving key features of a technology, or the effectiveness / efficiency / applicability of various concepts or algorithms. However, evolving into commercial products is many times at least as challenging as building the prototypes. In case of software-based projects, this means changes in architecture, a lot of code rewriting and important usability improvements. This paper introduces a software-concept product design algorithm which aims to minimize the effort required in turning a demonstrator into a commercial product. This is done by generating two functionality sets: a pure demonstrator and a pure commercial one, then generating a hybrid functionality set with the corresponding architecture, and then assessing each functionality for the demonstrator and the commercial version in terms of development and improvement effort. Through iterations, in which the original functionality sets are improved, the difference between the two perspectives will be reduced until it gets below a reasonable limit in terms of effort. The paper presents a case study in which the algorithm is applied for planning a software platform for supporting SMEs in their innovation processes.},

  abstract = {Software architecture has been established in software engineering for almost 40 years. When developing and evolving software products, architecture is expected to be even more relevant compared to contract development. However, the research results seem not to have influenced the development practice around software products very much. The architecture often only exists implicitly in discussions that accompany the development. Nonetheless many of the software products have been used for over 10, or even 20 years. How do development teams manage to accommodate changing needs and at the same time maintain the quality of the product? In order to answer this question, grounded theory study based on 15 semi-structured interviews was conducted in order to find out about the wide spectrum of architecture practices in software product developing organisations. Our results indicate that a chief architect or central developer acts as a âwalking architecture' devising changes and discussing local designs while at the same time updating his own knowledge about problematic aspects that need to be addressed. Architecture documentation and representations might not be used, especially if they replace the feedback from on-going developments into the âarchitecturing' practices. Referring to results from Computer Supported Cooperative Work, we discuss how explicating the existing architecture needs to be complemented by social protocols to support the communication and knowledge sharing processes of the âwalking architecture'. },

  abstract = {Abstract Architecture constraints are specifications which enable developers to formalize design rules that architectures should respect, like the topological conditions of a given architecture pattern or style. These constraints can serve as a documentation to better understand an existing architecture description, or can serve as invariants that can be checked after the application of an architecture change to see whether design rules still hold. Like any specifications, architecture constraints are frequently subject to reuse. Besides, these constraints are specified and checked during architecture design time, when component descriptions are specified or selected from repositories, then instantiated and connected together to define architecture descriptions. These two facts (being subject to reuse and instantiation/connection) make architecture constraints good candidates for component-based design within a unified environment. In this paper, we propose a component model for specifying architecture constraints. This model has been implemented as an extension to an {\{}ADL{\}} that we have developed, which is called CLACS. The obtained process advocates the idea of specifying architecture constraints using the same paradigm of component-based development as for architecture description. To evaluate the component model, we conducted an experiment with a catalog of constraints formalizing the topological conditions of architecture patterns. The results of this experiment showed that constraint specification is improved by this reuse-by-composition model. },

Software architecture analysis methods aim to analyze the quality of software-intensive system early at the software architecture design level and before a system is implemented. We propose a Software Architecture Reliability Analysis Approach (SARAH) that benefits from mature reliability engineering techniques and scenario-based software architecture analysis to provide an early software reliability analysis at the architecture design level. {\{}SARAH{\}} defines the notion of failure scenario model that is based on the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis method (FMEA) in the reliability engineering domain. The failure scenario model is applied to represent so-called failure scenarios that are utilized to derive fault tree sets (FTS).

Despite conventional reliability analysis techniques which prioritize failures based on criteria such as safety concerns, in {\{}SARAH{\}} failure scenarios are prioritized based on severity from the end-user perspective. {\{}SARAH{\}} results in a failure analysis report that can be utilized to identify architectural tactics for improving the reliability of the software architecture.

The main part of software engineering methods, tools and technologies has developed around projects as the central organisational form of software development. A project organisation depends on clear bounds regarding scope, participants, development effort and lead-time. What happens when these conditions are not given? The article claims that this is the case for software product specific ecosystems. As software is increasingly developed, adopted and deployed in the form of customisable and configurable products, software engineering as a discipline needs to take on the challenge to support software ecosystems.
Objective
The article provides a holistic understanding of the observed and reported practices as a starting point to device specific support for the development in software ecosystems.
Method
A qualitative interview study was designed based on previous long-term ethnographical inspired research.
Results
The analysis results in a set of common features of product development and evolution despite differences in size, kind of software and business models. Design is distributed and needs to be coordinated across heterogeneous design constituencies that, together with the software, build a product specific socio-technical ecosystem. The technical design has to support the deference of part of the development not only to 3rd-party developers but also to local designers tailoring the software in the use organisation. The technical interfaces that separate the work of different design constituencies are contested and need to be maintained permanently. Development takes place as cycles within cycles â overlaying development cycles with different rhythms to accommodate different evolution drivers.
Conclusion
The reported practices challenge some of the very core assumptions of traditional software engineering, but makes perfect sense, considering that the frame of reference for product development is not a project but continuous innovation across the respective ecosystem. The article provides a number of concrete points for further research.},

  abstract = {Software process improvement methods help to continuously refine and adjust the software process to improve its performance (e.g., in terms of lead-time, quality of the software product, reduction of change requests, and so forth). Lean software development propagates two important principles that help process improvement, namely identification of waste in the process and considering interactions between the individual parts of the software process from an end-to-end perspective. A large shift of thinking about the own way of working is often required to adopt lean. One of the potential main sources of failure is to try to make a too large shift about the ways of working at once. Therefore, the change to lean has to be done in a continuous and incremental way. In response to this we propose a novel approach to bring together the quality improvement paradigm and lean software development practices, the approach being called Software Process Improvement through the Lean Measurement (SPI-LEAM) Method. The method allows to assess the performance of the development process and take continuous actions to arrive at a more lean software process over time. The method is under implementation in industry and an initial evaluation of the method has been performed.},

  abstract = {Control systems for autonomous robots are concurrent, distributed, embedded, real-time and data intensive software systems. A real-world robot control system is composed of tens of software components. For each component providing robotic functionality, tens of different implementations may be available. The difficult challenge in robotic system engineering consists in selecting a coherent set of components, which provide the functionality required by the application requirements, taking into account their mutual dependencies. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that robotics system integrators and application developers are usually not specifically trained in software engineering. In various application domains, software product line (SPL) development has proven to be the most effective approach to face this kind of challenges. In a previous paper [D. Brugali and N. Hochgeschwender, Managing the functional variability of robotic perception systems, in First IEEE Int. Conf. Robotic Computing, 2017, pp. 277-283.] we have presented a model-based approach to the development of SPL for robotic perception systems, which integrates two modeling technologies developed by the authors: The HyperFlex toolkit [L. Gherardi and D. Brugali, Modeling and reusing robotic software architectures: The HyperFlex toolchain, in IEEE Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation, 2014, pp. 6414-6420.] and the Robot Perception Specification Language (RPSL) [N. Hochgeschwender, S. Schneider, H. Voos and G. K.

  abstract  = {Software product line (SPL) engineering has been applied in several domains, especially in large-scale software development. Given the benefits experienced and reported, SPL engineering has increasingly garnered interest from small to medium-sized companies. It is possible to find a wide range of studies reporting on the challenges of running a SPL project in large companies. However, very little reports exist that consider the situation for small to medium-sized enterprises and these studies try develop universal truths for SPL without lessons learned from empirical evidence need to be contextualized. This study is a step towards bridging this gap in contextual evidence by characterizing the weaknesses discovered in the scoping (SC) and requirements (RE) disciplines of SPL. Moreover, in this study we conducted a case study in a small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to justify the use of agile methods when introducing the SPL SC and RE disciplines through the characterization of their bottlenecks. The results of the characterization indicated that ineffective communication and collaboration, long iteration cycles, and the absence of adaptability and flexibility can increase the effort and reduce motivation during project development. These issues can be mitigated by agile methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Abstract Context: Traceability in Software Product Lines (SPL) is the ability to interrelate software engineering artifacts through required links to answer specific questions related to the families of products and underlying development processes. Despite the existence of studies to map out available evidence on traceability for single systems development, there is a lack of understanding on common strategies, activities, artifacts, and research gaps for {\{}SPL{\}} traceability. Objective: This paper analyzes 62 studies dating from 2001 to 2015 and discusses seven aspects of {\{}SPL{\}} traceability: main goals, strategies, application domains, research intensity, research challenges, rigor, and industrial relevance. In addition to the analysis, this paper also synthesizes the available evidence, identifies open issues and points out areas calling for further research. Method: To gather evidence, we defined a mapping study process adapted from existing guidelines. Driven by a set of research questions, this process comprises three major phases: planning, conducting, and documenting the review. Results: This work provides a structured understanding of {\{}SPL{\}} traceability, indicating areas for further research. The lack of evidence regarding the application of research methods indicates the need for more rigorous {\{}SPL{\}} traceability studies with better description of context, study design, and limitations. For practitioners, although most identified studies have low industrial relevance, a few of them have high relevance and thus could provide some decision making support for application of {\{}SPL{\}} traceability in practice. Conclusions: This work concludes that {\{}SPL{\}} traceability is maturing and pinpoints areas where further investigation should be performed. As future work, we intend to improve the comparison between traceability proposals for {\{}SPL{\}} and single-system development. },

Unlike other process perspectives, such as control flow, for which many different types of analyses have been proposed, such as finding deadlocks, there is an important gap regarding the human resource perspective. Resource analysis in business processes has not been defined, and only a few analysis operations can be glimpsed in previous approaches. In this paper, we identify and formally define seven design-time analysis operations related to how resources are involved in process activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a wide variety of resource-aware {\{}BP{\}} models, those analysis operations can be automated by leveraging Description Logic (DL) off-the-shelf reasoners. To this end, we rely on Resource Assignment Language (RAL), a domain-specific language that enables the definition of conditions to select the candidates to participate in a process activity. We provide a complete formal semantics for {\{}RAL{\}} based on {\{}DLs{\}} and extend it to address the operations, for which the control flow of the process must also be taken into consideration. A proof-of-concept implementation has been developed and integrated in a system called CRISTAL. As a result, we can give an automatic answer to different questions related to the management of resources in business processes at design time. },

  abstract = {Dynamic software product lines (DSPLs) propose elaborated design and implementation principles for engineering highly configurable runtime-adaptive systems in a sustainable and feature-oriented way. For this, DSPLs add to classical software product lines (SPL) the notions of (1) staged (pre-)configurations with dedicated binding times for each individual feature, and (2) continuous runtime reconfigurations of dynamic features throughout the entire product life cycle. Especially in the context of safety- and mission-critical systems, the design of reliable DSPLs requires capabilities for accurately specifying and validating arbitrary complex constraints among configuration parameters and/or respective reconfiguration options. Compared to classical SPL domain analysis which is usually based on Boolean constraint solving, DSPL validation, therefore, further requires capabilities for checking temporal properties of reconfiguration processes. In this article, we present a comprehensive approach for modeling and automatically verifying essential validity properties of staged reconfiguration processes with complex binding time constraints during DSPL domain engineering. The novel modeling concepts introduced are motivated by (re-)configuration constraints apparent in a real-world industrial case study from the automation engineering domain, which are not properly expressible and analyzable using state-of-the-art SPL domain modeling approaches. We present a prototypical tool implementation based on the model checker SPIN and present evaluation results obtained from our industrial case study, demonstrating the applicability of the approach. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Context Architecture description languages (ADLs) are a well-accepted approach to software architecture representation. The majority of well-known {\{}ADLs{\}} are defined by means of components and connectors. Architectural connectors are mainly used to model interactions among components, specifying component communication and coordination separately. However, there are other properties that cut across several components and also affect component interactions (e.g. security). Objective It seems reasonable therefore to model how such crosscutting properties affect component interactions as part of connectors. Method Using an aspect-oriented approach, the AO-ADL architecture description language extends the classical connector semantics with enough expressiveness to model the influences of such crosscutting properties on component interactions (defined as âaspectual compositions' in connectors). Results This paper describes the AO-ADL language putting special emphasis on the extended connectors used to specify aspectual and non-aspectual compositions between concrete components. The contributions of AO-ADL are validated using concern-oriented metrics available in the literature. Conclusion The measured indicators show that using AO-ADL it is possible to specify more reusable and scalable software architectures. },

If several alternative evolutions of a model are possible, each alternative has to be modeled and verified to find the best model for further development. We present a verification strategy to analyze whether evolution preserves given security properties. The UMLchange profile is used for specifying potential evolutions of a given model simultaneously. We present a tool that reads these annotations and computes a delta containing all possible evolution paths.

No phase was spared: several conceptual formalisms (e.g. ER, UML, ontological), various logical models (e.g. relational, object, key-value), a wide panoply of physical optimization structures and deployment platforms have been proposed. As a result, the database design process has become more complex involving more tasks and even more actors (as database architect or analyst). Getting inspired from software engineering in dealing with variable similar systems, we propose a methodological framework for a variability-aware design of databases, whereby this latter is henceforth devised as a Software Product Line. Doing so guarantees a high reuse, automation, and customizability in generating ready-to-be implemented databases. We also propose a solution to help users make a suitable choice among the wide panoply. Finally, a case study is presented. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) are families of software systems sharing common assets and exhibiting variabilities specific to each product member of the family. Commonalities and variabilities are often represented as features organized in a feature model. Due to combinatorial explosion of the number of products induced by possible features combinations, exhaustive testing of SPLs is intractable. Therefore, sampling and prioritization techniques have been proposed to generate sorted lists of products based on coverage criteria or weights assigned to features. Solely based on the feature model, these techniques do not take into account behavioural usage of such products as a source of prioritization. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of integrating usage models into the testing process to derive statistical testing approaches for SPLs. Usage models are given as Markov chains, enabling prioritization of probable/rare behaviours. We used featured transition systems, compactly modelling variability and behaviour for SPLs, to determine which products are realizing prioritized behaviours. Statistical prioritization can achieve a significant reduction in the state space, and modelling efforts can be rewarded by better automation. In particular, we used MaTeLo, a statistical test cases generation suite developed at ALL4TEC. We assess feasibility criteria on two systems: Claroline, a configurable course management system, and Sferionâ¢, an embedded system providing helicopter landing assistance. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Product line engineering allows for the rapid development of variants of a domain specific application by using a common set of reusable assets often known as core assets. Variability modeling is a critical issue in product line engineering, where the use of feature modeling is one of most commonly used formalisms. To support an effective and automated derivation of concrete products for a product family, staged configuration has been proposed in the research literature. In this paper, we propose the integration of well-known requirements engineering principles into stage configuration. Being inspired by the well-established Preview requirements engineering framework, we initially propose an extension of feature models with capabilities for capturing business oriented requirements. This representation enables a more effective capturing of stakeholders' preferences over the business requirements and objectives (e.g.,. implementation costs or security) in the form of fuzzy linguistic variables (e.g., high, medium, and low). On top of this extension, we propose a novel method, the Stratified Analytic Hierarchy process, which first helps to rank and select the most relevant high level business objectives for the target stakeholders (e.g., security over implementation costs), and then helps to rank and select the most relevant features from the feature model to be used as the starting point in the staged configuration process. Besides a complete formalization of the process, we define the place of our proposal in existing software product line lifecycles as well as demonstrate the use of our proposal on the widely-used e-Shop case study. Finally, we report on the results of our user study, which indicates a high appreciation of the proposed method by the participating industrial software developers. The tool support for S-AHP is also introduced. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The dynamic nature of real-world systems means that product line models need to evolve continuously to meet new customer requirements and to reflect changes of product line artifacts. To address these challenges, product line engineers need to apply different strategies for structuring the modeling space to ease the creation and maintenance of models. This paper presents an approach that aims at reducing the maintenance effort by organizing product lines as a set of interrelated model fragments defining the variability of particular parts of the system. We provide support to semi-automatically merge fragments into complete product line models. We also provide support to automatically detect inconsistencies between product line artifacts and the models representing these artifacts after changes. Furthermore, our approach supports the co-evolution of models and their respective meta-models. We discuss strategies for structuring the modeling space and show the usefulness of our approach using real-world examples from our ongoing industry collaboration. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Since the emergence of the aspect oriented paradigm, several studies have been conducted to test the contribution of this new paradigm compared to the object paradigm. However, in addition to this type of studies, we need also comparative studies that assess the aspect approaches mutually. The motivations of the latter include the enhancement of each aspect approach, devising hybrid approaches or merely helping developers choosing the suitable approach according to their needs. Comparing advanced separation of concerns approaches is the context of our work. Objective We aim at making an assessment of how the aspect approaches deal with crosscutting concerns. This assessment is based on quantitative attributes such as coupling and cohesion that evaluate the modularity as well as on qualitative observations. Method We selected three of well-known aspect approaches: AspectJ, {\{}JBoss{\}} {\{}AOP{\}} and CaesarJ, all the three based on Java. We conducted then, a comparative study using the GoF design patterns. In order to be fair we asked a group of Master students to achieve the implementation of all patterns with the three approaches. The use of these implementations as hypothetical benchmarks allowed us to achieve two kinds of comparison: a quantitative one based on structural and performance metrics, and qualitative one based on observations collected during the implementation phase. Results The quantitative comparison shows some advantages like the using of fewer components with AspectJ and the strong cohesion with CaesarJ and weaknesses, as the high internal coupling caused by the inner classes of CaesarJ. The qualitative comparison gives comments about the approach understandability and others qualitative concepts. Conclusion This comparison highlighted strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and provided a referential work that can help choosing the right approach during software development, enhancing aspect approaches or devising hybrid approaches that combine best features. },

Software vendors and suppliers commonly typically maintain their own product lines, which contribute to a larger (multi) product line or software ecosystem. It is unrealistic to assume that the participating organizations will agree on using a specific variability modeling techniqueâthey will rather use different approaches and tools to manage the variability of their systems. Objective We aim to support product configuration in software ecosystems based on several variability models with different semantics that have been created using different notations. Method We present an integrative approach that provides a unified perspective to users configuring products in multi product line environments, regardless of the different modeling methods and tools used internally. We also present a technical infrastructure and a prototype implementation based on web services. Results We show the feasibility of the approach and its implementation by using it with the three most widespread types of variability modeling approaches in the product line community, i.e., feature-based, OVM-style, and decision-oriented modeling. To demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of our approach, we present an example derived from industrial experience in enterprise resource planning. We further applied the approach to support the configuration of privacy settings in the Android ecosystem based on multiple variability models. We also evaluated the performance of different model enactment strategies used in our approach. Conclusions Tools and techniques allowing stakeholders to handle variability in a uniform manner can considerably foster the initiation and growth of software ecosystems from the perspective of software reuse and configuration. },

  abstract = {Abstract The contribution of this paper to a general theory of software engineering is twofold: it presents the model system concept, and it integrates the software engineering design process into a decision making theory and a value-based decision-under-risk process. The model system concept is defined as a collection of interconnected and consistent components that work together for defining, developing, and delivering a software system. This model system concept is used to represent the multiple facets of a software engineering project such as stakeholders and models related to domain/environment, success, decision, product, process, and property. The model system concept is derived from software development practices in the industry and academia. The theoretical decision framework acts as a central governance component for a given software engineering project. Applying this decision framework allows for effectively managing risks and uncertainties related to success in the project building stage. Especially, this puts the design process in an economic perspective, where concepts such as value-of-waiting, value-of-information and possible outcomes can be coped with explicitly. In practice, the decision framework allows for the optimal control of modern adaptive software development. In particular, one can use dynamic programming to find the optimal sequence of decisions to be made considering a defined time horizon. In this way we can relate our contribution to a theory of software engineering to the well-studied areas of automatic control, optimization, decision theory and Bayesian analysis. Computational case studies exemplify the conceptual innovations proposed in this paper. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Although Agile software development models have been widely used as a base for the software project life-cycle since 1990s, the number of studies that follow a sound empirical method and quantitatively reveal the effect of using these models over Traditional models is scarce. Objective This article explains the empirical method of and the results from systematic analyses and comparison of development performance and product quality of Incremental Process and Agile Process adapted in two projects of a middle-size, telecommunication software development company. The Incremental Process is an adaption of the Waterfall Model whereas the newly introduced Agile Process is a combination of the Unified Software Development Process, Extreme Programming, and Scrum. Method The method followed to perform the analyses and comparison is benefited from the combined use of qualitative and quantitative methods. It utilizes; {\{}GQM{\}} Approach to set measurement objectives, {\{}CMMI{\}} as the reference model to map the activities of the software development processes, and a pre-defined assessment approach to verify consistency of process executions and evaluate measure characteristics prior to quantitative analysis. Results The results of the comparison showed that the Agile Process had performed better than the Incremental Process in terms of productivity (79{\%}), defect density (57{\%}), defect resolution effort ratio (26{\%}), Test Execution V{\&}V Effectiveness (21{\%}), and effort prediction capability (4{\%}). These results indicate that development performance and product quality achieved by following the Agile Process was superior to those achieved by following the Incremental Process in the projects compared. Conclusion The acts of measurement, analysis, and comparison enabled comprehensive review of the two development processes, and resulted in understanding their strengths and weaknesses. The comparison results constituted objective evidence for organization-wide deployment of the Agile Process in the company. },

  abstract = {Abstract A recent line of work lifts particular verification and analysis methods to Software Product Linesâ(SPL). In an effort to generalize such case-by-case approaches, we develop a systematic methodology for lifting single-program analyses to {\{}SPLs{\}} using abstract interpretation. Abstract interpretation is a classical framework for deriving static analyses in a compositional, step-by-step manner. We show how to take an analysis expressed as an abstract interpretation and lift each of the abstract interpretation steps to a family of programs (SPL). This includes schemes for lifting domain types, and combinators for lifting analyses and Galois connections. We prove that for analyses developed using our method, the soundness of lifting follows by construction. The resulting variational abstract interpretation is a conceptual framework for understanding, deriving, and validating static analyses for SPLs. Then we show how to derive the corresponding variational dataflow equations for an example static analysis, a constant propagation analysis. We also describe how to approximate variability by applying variability-aware abstractions to {\{}SPL{\}} analysis. Finally, we discuss how to efficiently implement our method and present some evaluation results. },

We can use aspect-oriented software development to decompose software product lines based on features that can ease configuration management.

In particular, we applied a specific approach, feature based modeling (FBM), in the construction of the system. We have extended FBM to address properties specific to product line. We will discuss the advantages of FBM when applied to product lines. Such gains include the functional decomposition of the system along user requirements (features) as aspects. Moreover, those features exhibit unidirectional dependency (i.e. among any two features, at most one depend on another) that enables developers to analyze the effect of any modification they may make on any feature. In addition, any variations can be captured as aspects which can also be incorporated easily into the core asset if such variation is deemed to be important enough to be included in the product line for further evolution. {\textcopyright} World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Unfortunately, relevant knowledge collected in the SLR process is not publicly available, which considerably slows down building BoKs incrementally. Objective. We present and evaluate the Systematic Knowledge Engineering (SKE) process to support efficiently building BoKs from published research. Method. SKE is based on the SLR process and on Knowledge Engineering practices to build a Knowledge Base (KB) by reusing intermediate data extraction results from SLRs. We evaluated the feasibility of applying SKE by building a Software Inspection BoK KB from published experiments and a Software Product Line BoK KB from published experience reports. We compared the effort, benefits, and risks of building BoK KBs regarding the SKE and the traditional SLR processes. Results. The application of SKE for incrementally collecting and organizing knowledge in the context of a BoK was feasible for different domains and different types of evidence. While the efforts for conducting the SKE and traditional SLR processes are comparable, SKE provides significant benefits for building BoKs. Conclusions. SKE enables researchers in a scientific community to reuse and incrementally build knowledge in a BoK. SKE is ready to be evaluated in other software engineering domains. {\textcopyright} 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

  abstract = {Context A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist. Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Background
Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have gained significant popularity among Software Engineering (SE) researchers since 2004. Several researchers have also been working on improving the scientific and methodological infrastructure to support SLRs in SE. We argue that there is also an apparent and essential need for evidence-based body of knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of SLRs in SE.
Objective
The main objective of this research is to empirically investigate the adoption, value, and use of SLRs in SE research from various perspectives.
Method
We used mixed-methods approach (systematically integrating tertiary literature review, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire-based survey) as it is based on a combination of complementary research methods which are expected to compensate each others' limitations.
Results
A large majority of the participants are convinced of the value of using a rigourous and systematic methodology for literature reviews in SE research. However, there are concerns about the required time and resources for SLRs. One of the most important motivators for performing SLRs is new findings and inception of innovative ideas for further research. The reported SLRs are more influential compared to the traditional literature reviews in terms of number of citations. One of the main challenges of conducting SLRs is drawing a balance between methodological rigour and required effort.
Conclusions
SLR has become a popular research methodology for conducting literature review and evidence aggregation in SE. There is an overall positive perception about this relatively new methodology to SE research. The findings provide interesting insights into different aspects of SLRs. We expect that the findings can provide valuable information to readers about what can be expected from conducting SLRs and the potential impact of such reviews.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent software engineering paradigms such as software product lines, supporting development techniques like feature modeling, and cloud provisioning models such as platform and infrastructure as a service, allow for great flexibility during both software design and deployment, resulting in potentially large cost savings. However, all this flexibility comes with a catch: as the combinatorial complexity of optional design features and deployment variability increases, the difficulty of assessing system qualities such as scalability and quality of service increases too. And if the software itself is not scalable (for instance, because of a specific set of selected features), deploying additional service instances is a futile endeavor. Clearly there is a need to systematically measure the impact of feature selection on scalability, as the potential cost savings can be completely mitigated by the risk of having a system that is unable to meet service demand. In this work, we document our results on systematic load testing for automated quality of service and scalability analysis. The major contribution of our work is tool support and a methodology to analyze the scalability of these distributed, feature oriented multi-tenant software systems in a continuous integration process. We discuss our approach to select features for load testing such that a representative set of feature combinations is used to elicit valuable information on the performance impact and feature interactions. Additionally, we highlight how our methodology and framework for performance and scalability prediction differs from state-of-practice solutions. We take the viewpoint of both the tenant of the service and the service provider, and report on our experiences applying the approach to an industrial use case in the domain of electronic payments. We conclude that the integration of systematic scalability tests in a continuous integration process offers strong advantages to software developers and service providers, such as the ability to quantify the impact of new features in existing service compositions, and the early detection of hidden feature interactions that may negatively affect the overall performance of multi-tenant services. },

  abstract = {Delta modeling is a modular, yet flexible approach to capture variability by explicitly representing differences between system variants or versions. The conceptual idea of delta modeling is language-independent. But, to apply delta modeling to a concrete language, either a generic transformation language has to be used or the corresponding delta language has to be manually developed for each considered base language. Generic languages and their tool support often lack readability and specific context condition checking, since they are unrelated to the base language. In this paper, we present a process that allows synthesizing a delta language from the grammar of a given base language. Our method relies on an automatically generated language extension that can be manually adapted to meet domain-specific needs. We illustrate our method using delta modeling on a textual variant of architecture diagrams. Furthermore, we evaluate our method using a comparative case study. This case study covers an architectural, a structural, and a behavioral language and compares the preexisting handwritten grammars to the generated grammars as well as the manually tailored grammars.

The conventional PHA involves brainstorming among experts on various portions of the system to identify hazards through discussions. However, since the conventional PHA is not a systematic technique, the analysis results depend strongly on the experts' subjective opinions. The quality of analysis cannot be appropriately controlled. Therefore, this study presents a system-level sequence tree based PHA, which can clarify the relationship among the major digital I{\&}C systems. This sequence-tree-based technique has two major phases. The first phase adopts a table to analyze each event in SAR Chapter 15 for a specific safety-related I{\&}C system, such as RPS. The second phase adopts a sequence tree to recognize the I{\&}C systems involved in the event, the working of the safety-related systems and how the backup systems can be activated to mitigate the consequence if the primary safety systems fail. The defense-in-depth echelons, namely the Control echelon, Reactor trip echelon, ESFAS echelon and Monitoring and indicator echelon, are arranged to build the sequence-tree structure. All the related I{\&}C systems, including the digital systems and the analog back-up systems, are allocated in their specific echelons. This system-centric sequence-tree analysis not only systematically identifies preliminary hazards, but also vulnerabilities in a nuclear power plant.

  abstract = {Abstract Multi-tenancy architecture (MTA) is often used in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and the central idea is that multiple tenant applications can be developed using components stored in the SaaS infrastructure. Recently, {\{}MTA{\}} has been extended to allow a tenant application to have its own sub-tenants, where the tenant application acts like a SaaS infrastructure. In other words, {\{}MTA{\}} is extended to {\{}STA{\}} (Sub-Tenancy Architecture). In STA, each tenant application needs not only to develop its own functionalities, but also to prepare an infrastructure to allow its sub-tenants to develop customized applications. This paper applies Crowdsourcing as the core to {\{}STA{\}} component in the development life cycle. In addition, to discovering adequate fit tenant developers or components to help build and compose new components, dynamic and static ranking models are proposed. Furthermore, rank computation architecture is presented to deal with the case when the number of tenants and components becomes huge. Finally, experiments are performed to demonstrate that the ranking models and the rank computation architecture work as design. },

  abstract = {Abstract The use of cloud computing brings many new opportunities for companies to deliver software in a highly-customizable and dynamic way. One such paradigm, Software as a Service (SaaS), allows users to subscribe and unsubscribe to services as needed. While beneficial to both subscribers and SaaS service providers, failures escaping to the field in these systems can potentially impact an entire customer base. Build Acceptance Testing (BAT) is a black box technique performed to validate the quality of a SaaS system every time a build is generated. In BAT, the same set of test cases is executed simultaneously across many different servers, making this a time consuming test process. Since {\{}BAT{\}} contains the most critical use cases, it may not be obvious which tests to perform first, given that the time to complete all test cases across different servers in any given day may be insufficient. While all tests must be eventually run, it is critical to run those tests first which are likely to find failures. In this work, we ask if it is possible to prioritize {\{}BAT{\}} tests for improved time to fault detection and present several different approaches, each based on the services executed when running each BAT. In an empirical study on a production enterprise system, we first analyze the historical data from several months in the field, and then use that data to derive the prioritization order for the current development BATs. We then examine if the orders change significantly when we consider fault severity using a cost-based prioritization metric. We find that the prioritization order in which we run the tests does matter, and that the use of historical information is a good heuristic for this order. Prioritized tests have an increase in the rate of fault detection, with the average percent of faults detected (APFD) increasing from less than 0.30 to as high as 0.77 on a scale of zero to one. Although severity slightly changes which order performs best, we see that there are clusters of orderings, ones which improve time to early fault detection ones which don't. },

Due to repeated testing: across different testing levels, over time (test for regression) as well as of different variants, the risk of redundant testing is large as well as the risk of overlooking important tests, hidden by the huge amount of possible tests. Aims: This study assesses the amount and type of overlaid manual testing across feature, integration and system test in such context, it explores the causes of potential redundancy and elaborates on how to provide decision support in terms of visualization for the purpose of avoiding redundancy. Method: An in-depth case study was launched including both qualitative and quantitative observations. Results: A high degree of test overlay is identified originating from distributed test responsibilities, poor documentation and structure of test cases, parallel work and insufficient delta analysis. The amount of test overlay depends on which level of abstraction is studied. Conclusions: Avoiding redundancy requires tool support, e.g. visualization of test design coverage, test execution progress, priorities of coverage items as well as visualized priorities of variants to support test case selection. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the distributed approach is not without risks, and organizations implement specific test strategies to assist in the verification process of work-in-progress software artifacts. This paper discusses the test strategies adopted in the software development lifecycle by a service provider pursuing distributed software development in New Zealand, Australia, and India. Verification and validation processes have been deployed to ascertain the quality, security and traceability of artifacts developed in distributed sites. Findings reveal that strategies are based on protection of sensitive data through management of test database, use of drivers and interfacing stub supports between modules, as well as compliance verification on incremental releases through a customized âSynchronize and Stabilizeâ lifecycle model. A staging environment, within the case business context, is used for evaluating the robustness of the software product before its official launch in production environment. The actual ongoing work practices within distributed software business environments are presented, which provide value to academia, industry, {\{}ICT{\}} sector and government institutions.},

Finding interactions to uncover specific faults is like finding a needle in a haystack. Can we surgically generate a test database for interactions that interest testers? We address this question with a methodology and tool Faktum to automatically populate a test database that covers all T-wise interactions for selected features. Faktum generates a constraint model of interactions in Alloy and solves it using a divide-and-combine strategy.

The first method provides easy management of test cases by managing functions to be tested and configurations to be tested separately. The second method involves automatic testing of real devices based on model checking technologies.

This paper introduces the Abstract Behavioural Specification (ABS) language and tool suite, a comprehensive platform for developing and analysing highly adaptable distributed concurrent software systems. The ABS language has a hybrid functional and object- oriented core, and comes with extensions that support the development of systems that are adaptable to diversified requirements, yet capable to maintain a high level of trustworthiness. Using ABS, system variability is consistently traceable from the level of requirements engineering down to object behaviour. This facilitates temporal evolution, as changes to the required set of features of a system are automatically reflected by functional adaptation of the system's behaviour. The analysis capabilities of ABS stretch from debugging, observing and simulating to resource analysis of ABS models and help ensure that a system will remain dependable throughout its evolutionary lifetime. We report on the experience of using the ABS language and the ABS tool suite in an industrial case study. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Current consumer electronics products are built using components from a large variety of specialized firms, whereas previously each product was developed by a single, vertically integrated company. Taking a software development perspective, we analyze the transition in the consumer electronics industry using case studies from digital televisions and mobile phones. We introduce a model consisting of five industry structure types and describe the forces that govern the transition between types and we describe the consequences for software architectures. We conclude that, at this point in time, software supply chains are the dominant industry structure for developing consumer electronics products. This is because the modularization of the architecture is limited, due to the lack of industry-wide standards and because resource constrained devices require variants of supplied software that are optimized for different hardware configurations. Due to these characteristics open ecosystems have not been widely adopted. The model and forces can serve the decision making process for individual companies that consider the transition to a different type of industry structure as well as provide a framework for researchers studying the software-intensive industries. },

Social interdependence theory provides a structure to examine whether collaborative efforts promote behaviors that result in higher levels of success. Using resource interdependence as an indicator of collaboration, a model of promotive behaviors is developed using the lens of social interdependence. Expectations are that resource interdependence conditions will promote more mutual support, effort, and communication. In turn, these behaviors will lead to an improvement in the business objectives and operational efficiency of the organization. A survey of program and project managers in information system vendors located in India support the model.

However, despite some evidence in terms of the number and quality of its outcomes, there is no organized characterization of the AOSD-BR community that positions it against the international {\{}AOSD{\}} Research community and the Software Engineering Research community in Brazil. Aims In this paper, our main goal is to characterize the AOSD-BR community with respect to the research developed in the last decade, confronting it with the {\{}AOSD{\}} international community and the Brazilian Software Engineering community. Method Data collection, validation and analysis were performed in collaboration with several researchers of the AOSD-BR community. The characterization was presented from three different perspectives: (i) a historical timeline of events and main milestones achieved by the community; (ii) an overview of the research developed by the community, in terms of key challenges, open issues and related work; and (iii) an analysis on the impact of the AOSD-BR community outcomes in terms of well-known indicators, such as number of papers and number of citations. Results Our analysis showed that the AOSD-BR community has impacted both the international {\{}AOSD{\}} Research community and the Software Engineering Research community in Brazil. },

  abstract = {A Software Product Line is a set of software systems of a domain, which share some common features but also have significant variability. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact which represents differences among software products with respect to variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by selecting features in the feature model (referred to as the configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model. However, feature model configuration can be a cumbersome task because: 1) feature models may consist of a large number of features, which are hard to comprehend and maintain; and 2) many factors including technical limitations, implementation costs, stakeholders' requirements and expectations must be considered in the configuration process. Recognizing these issues, a significant amount of research efforts has been dedicated to different aspects of feature model configuration such as automating the configuration process. Several approaches have been proposed to alleviate the feature model configuration challenges through applying visualization and interaction techniques. However, there have been limited empirical insights available into the impact of visualization and interaction techniques on the feature model configuration process. In this paper, we present a set of visualization and interaction interventions for representing and configuring feature models, which are then empirically validated to measure the impact of the proposed interventions. An empirical study was conducted by following the principles of control experiments in software engineering and by applying the well-known software quality standard ISO 9126 to operationalize the variables investigated in the experiment. The results of the empirical study revealed that the employed visualization and interaction interventions significantly improved completion time of comprehension and changing of the feature model configuration. Additionally, according to results, the proposed interventions are easy-to-use and easy-to-learn for the participants. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {AbstractContext Model-based testing (MBT) aims to generate executable test cases from behavioral models of software systems. {\{}MBT{\}} gains interest in industry and academia due to its provision of systematic, automated, and comprehensive testing. Researchers have successfully applied search-based techniques (SBTs) by automating the search for an optimal set of test cases at reasonable cost compared to other more expensive techniques. Thus, there is a recent surge toward the applications of {\{}SBTs{\}} for {\{}MBT{\}} because the generated test cases are optimal and have low computational cost. However, successful, future {\{}SBTs{\}} for {\{}MBT{\}} applications demand deep insight into its existing experimental applications that underlines stringent issues and challenges, which is lacking in the literature. Objective The objective of this study is to comprehensively analyze the current state-of-the-art of the experimental applications of {\{}SBTs{\}} for {\{}MBT{\}} and present the limitations of the current literature to direct future research. Method We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using 72 experimental papers from six data sources. We proposed a taxonomy based on the literature to categorize the characteristics of the current applications. Results The results indicate that the majority of the existing applications of {\{}SBTs{\}} for {\{}MBT{\}} focus on functional and structural coverage purposes, as opposed to stress testing, regression testing and graphical user interface (GUI) testing. We found research gaps in the existing applications in five areas: applying multi-objective SBTs, proposing hybrid techniques, handling complex constraints, addressing data and requirement-based adequacy criteria, and adapting landscape visualization. Only twelve studies proposed and empirically evaluated the {\{}SBTs{\}} for complex systems in MBT. Conclusion This extensive systematic analysis of the existing literature based on the proposed taxonomy enables to assist researchers in exploring the existing research efforts and reveal the limitations that need additional investigation. },

The aim of this tertiary study is to consolidate empirical evidence regarding Agile and Lean practices and their respective impacts on project constraints as defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK): scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources, communication, and risk. In this tertiary study, 13 secondary studies were included for detailed analysis. Given the heterogeneity of the data, we were unable to perform a rigorous synthesis. Instead, we mapped the identified Agile and Lean practices, and their impacts on the project constraints described in PMBOK. From 13 secondary studies, we identified 13 Agile and Lean practices. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is studied in ten secondary studies, meanwhile other practices are studied in only one or two secondary studies. This tertiary study provides a consolidated view of the impacts of Agile and Lean practices. The result of this tertiary study indicates that {\{}TDD{\}} has a positive impact on external quality. However, due to insufficient data or contradictory results, we were unable to make inferences on other Agile and Lean practices. Implications for research and practice are further discussed in the paper. },

  abstract = {Context Maturity models offer organizations a simple but effective possibility to measure the quality of their processes. Emerged out of software engineering, the application fields have widened and maturity model research is becoming more important. During the last two decades the publication amount steadily rose as well. Until today, no studies have been available summarizing the activities and results of the field of maturity model research. Objective The objective of this paper is to structure and analyze the available literature of the field of maturity model research to identify the state-of-the-art research as well as research gaps. Method A systematic mapping study was conducted. It included relevant publications of journals and {\{}IS{\}} conferences. Mapping studies are a suitable method for structuring a broad research field concerning research questions about contents, methods, and trends in the available publications. Results The mapping of 237 articles showed that current maturity model research is applicable to more than 20 domains, heavily dominated by software development and software engineering. The study revealed that most publications deal with the development of maturity models and empirical studies. Theoretical reflective publications are scarce. Furthermore, the relation between conceptual and design-oriented maturity model development was analyzed, indicating that there is still a gap in evaluating and validating developed maturity models. Finally, a comprehensive research framework was derived from the study results and implications for further research are given. Conclusion The mapping study delivers the first systematic summary of maturity model research. The categorization of available publications helps researchers gain an overview of the state-of-the-art research and current research gaps. The proposed research framework supports researchers categorizing their own projects. In addition, practitioners planning to use a maturity model may use the study as starting point to identify which maturity models are suitable for their domain and where limitations exist. },

Based on a controlled laboratory experiment, we find a positive effect of feature updates on users' CI. According to this effect, software vendors can increase their users' {\{}CI{\}} by delivering features through updates after a software has been released and is already used by customers. We also find that users prefer frequent feature updates over less frequent update packages that bundle several features in one update. However, the positive effect from updates occurs only with functional feature updates and not with technical non-feature updates, disclosing update frequency and update type as crucial moderators to this effect. Furthermore, we unveil that this beneficial effect of feature updates operates through positive disconfirmation of expectations, resulting in increased perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Implications for research and practice as well as directions for future research are discussed. },

  abstract = {Evolvability is widely considered to be a crucial characteristic of software architectures, particularly in the area of information systems. Although many approaches have been proposed for improving evolvability, most indications are that it remains challenging to deliver the required levels of evolvability. In this paper, we present a theoretical approach to how the concept of systems theoretic stability can be applied to the evolvability of software architectures of information systems. We define and formalize the transformation of a set of basic functional requirements into a set of instantiations of software constructs. We define this transformation using both a static and a dynamic perspective. In the latter perspective, we formulate the postulate that information systems should be stable against new requirements. Based on this postulate, we derive a number of design theorems for software implementation. Using this transformation we use theoretical arguments to derive that these theorems contribute to achieving stability. },

We outline a model, âCoat Hangerâ, for theorizing about development practices. The model focuses on the intended rationale for the actual realization and resulting impacts of using particular practices in varying contexts. To illustrate the use of the model, we have studied recent practice-oriented articles in the journal Science of Computer Programming. A survey of articles in the journal between 2010 and 2013 showed that out of 371 articles, only four studied software development in professional organizations with actual software practitioners as informants. The Coat Hanger model was then used to identify the theoretical strengths and weaknesses of these four practice descriptions. The analysis is used as the basis to declare the potential of our model as a conceptual aid for more structured theorizing about software development practices. The contribution of the model is the introduction of a concretization of how theorizing can be done through reflection-in-action, instead of regarding research on software practices plainly from the prevailing viewpoint of technical rationality. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext A software product line is a family of software systems that share some common features but also have significant variabilities. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact, which represents differences among software products with respect to the variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by binding the variation points in the feature model (called configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model. Objective In this work we address the feature model configuration problem and propose a framework to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the functional and non-functional preferences and constraints of stakeholders. Additionally, interdependencies between various non-functional properties are taken into account in the framework. Method The proposed framework combines Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) to compute the non-functional properties weights based on stakeholders' preferences and interdependencies between non-functional properties. Afterwards, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is applied to find the optimal feature model configuration. Result Our approach improves state-of-art of feature model configuration by considering positive or negative impacts of the features on non-functional properties, the stakeholders' preferences, and non-functional interdependencies. The approach presented in this paper extends earlier work presented in [1] from several distinct perspectives including mechanisms handling interdependencies between non-functional properties, proposing a novel tooling architecture, and offering visualization and interaction techniques for representing functional and non-functional aspects of feature models. Conclusion our experiments show the scalability of our configuration approach when considering both functional and non-functional requirements of stakeholders. },

In this paper, we address the optimization problem of SLA-constrained service composition and focus on the following issues: the difficulties related to preference definition and to weight assignment, the limitation of linear utility functions in identifying preferred skyline solutions, and the efficiency and scalability requirements of the optimization algorithm. We present a systematic approach based on a fuzzy preference model and on evolutionary algorithms. Specifically, we first model this multi-objective optimization problem using the weighted Tchebycheff distance rather than a linear utility function. We then present a fuzzy preference model for preference representation and weight assignment. In the model, a set of fuzzy linguistic preference terms and their properties are introduced for establishing consistent preference order of multiple QoS dimensions, and a weighting procedure is proposed to transform the preference into numeric weights. Finally, we present two evolutionary algorithms, i.e., single{\_}EA and hybrid{\_}EA, that implement different optimization objectives and that can be used in different {\{}SLA{\}} management scenarios for service composition. We conduct a set of experimental studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in determining the optimal solutions, and to evaluate their efficiency and scalability for different problem scales. },

Software estimators are notorious in predicting software effort and they have been struggling in the past decades to provide new models to enhance software estimation. The most critical and crucial part of software estimation is when estimation is required in the early stages of the software life cycle where the problem to be solved has not yet been completely revealed. This paper presents a novel log-linear regression model based on the use case point model (UCP) to calculate the software effort based on use case diagrams. A fuzzy logic approach is used to calibrate the productivity factor in the regression model. Moreover, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model was developed to predict software effort based on the software size and team productivity. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the original {\{}UCP{\}} model. Furthermore, a comparison between the {\{}MLP{\}} and log-linear regression models was conducted based on the size of the projects. Results demonstrate that the {\{}MLP{\}} model can surpass the regression model when small projects are used, but the log-linear regression model gives better results when estimating larger projects. },

  abstract = {Abstract Many large-scale software-intensive systems are produced as instances of component-based product families, a well-known tactic to develop a portfolio of software products based on a collection of shared assets. However, sharing components between software products introduces dependencies that complicate maintenance and evolution: changes made in a component to address an issue in one product may have undesirable effects on other products in which the same component is used. Therefore, developers not only need to understand how a proposed change will impact the component and product at hand; they also need to understand how it affects the whole product family, including systems that are already deployed. Given that these systems contain thousands of components, it is no surprise that it is hard to reason about the impact of a change on a single product, let alone assess the effects of more complex evolution scenarios on a complete product family. Conventional impact analysis techniques do not suffice for large-scale software-intensive systems and highly populated product families, and software engineers need better support to conduct these tasks. Finally, for an accountable comparison of alternative evolution scenarios, a measure is needed to quantify the scale of impact for each strategy. This is especially important in our context of safety-critical systems since these need to undergo (costly) re-certification after a change. Cost-effective recommendations should prioritize evolution scenarios that minimize impact scale, and thereby minimize re-certification efforts. This paper explores how reverse engineering and program comprehension techniques can be used to develop novel recommendation technology that uses concrete evidence gathered from software artifacts to support engineers with the evolution of families of complex, safety-critical, software-intensive systems. We give an overview of the state of the art in this area, discuss some of the research directions that have been considered up to now and, identify challenges, and pose a number of research questions to advance the state of the art. },

However, as any other system, software family infrastructures need to be evolved to add new components or constraints to the infrastructure.

We investigate formal safety analysis and verification for product lines of software-intensive embedded systems. We show how to uniformly augment a feature-oriented, model-based design approach with the specification of safety requirements, failure models and fault injection. Therefore we analyze system hazards and identify the causes, i.e. failures and inadequate control systematically. As features are themain concept of functional decomposition in the product line approach, features also direct the safety analysis and the specification of systemlevel safety requirements: Safety (design) constraints are allocated to features. Subsequently, the behavior including possible faults is formally modeled. Then formal verification techniques are employed in order to prove that the safety constraints are satisfied and the system level hazards are prevented. We demonstrate our method using SCADE Suite for the model-based product line design of cardiac pacemakers. VIATRA is employed for the model graph transformation generating the individual products. Formal safety analysis is performed by using SCADE Design Verifier. The case study shows that our approach leads to a fine-grained safety analysis and is capable of uncovering unwanted feature interactions. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

  abstract = {Security and requirements engineering are one of the most important factors of success in the development of a software product line due to the complexity and extensive nature of them, given that a weakness in security can cause problems throughout the products of a product line. The main contribution of this work is that of providing a security standard-based process for software product line development, which is an add-in of activities in the domain engineering. This process deals with security requirements from the early stages of the product line lifecycle in a systematic and intuitive way especially adapted for product line based development. It is based on the use of the latest security requirements techniques, together with the integration of the Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408) and the ISO/IEC 17799 controls into the product line lifecycle. Additionally, it deals with security artefacts variability and traceability, providing us with a Security Core Assets Repository. Moreover, it facilitates the conformance to the most relevant security standards with regard to the management of security requirements, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 17799. Finally, we will illustrate our proposed process by describing part of a real case study, as a preliminary validation of it. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Finding the appropriate developer to a {\{}CR{\}} is crucial for obtaining the lowest, economically feasible, fixing time.

In this paper, we report on a questionnaire-based survey with practitioners to understand the characteristics of {\{}CR{\}} assignment, and on a semi-automated approach for {\{}CR{\}} assignment which combines rule-based and machine learning techniques. In accordance with the results of the survey, the proposed approach emphasizes the use of contextual information, essential to effective assignments, and puts the development team in control of the assignment rules, toward making its adoption easier. The assignment rules can be either extracted from the assignment history or created from scratch. An empirical validation was performed through an offline experiment with {\{}CRs{\}} from a large software project. The results pointed out that the approach is up to 46.5{\%} more accurate than other approaches which relying solely on machine learning techniques. This indicates that a rule-based approach is a viable and simple method to leverage {\{}CR{\}} assignments. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext The use of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) has emerged in the {\{}IT{\}} arena for the automation of business processes. In the majority of cases, the issue of security is overlooked by default in these systems, and hence the potential cost and consequences of the materialization of threats could produce catastrophic loss for organizations. Therefore, the early selection of security controls that mitigate risks is a real and important necessity. Nevertheless, there exists an enormous range of {\{}IT{\}} security controls and their configuration is a human, manual, time-consuming and error-prone task. Furthermore, configurations are carried out separately from the organization perspective and involve many security stakeholders. This separation makes difficult to ensure the effectiveness of the configuration with regard to organizational requirements. Objective In this paper, we strive to provide security stakeholders with automated tools for the optimal selection of {\{}IT{\}} security configurations in accordance with a range of business process scenarios and organizational multi-criteria. Method An approach based on feature model analysis and constraint programming techniques is presented, which enable the automated analysis and selection of optimal security configurations. Results A catalogue of feature models is determined by analyzing typical {\{}IT{\}} security controls for {\{}BPMSs{\}} for the enforcement of the standard goals of security: integrity, confidentiality, availability, authorization, and authentication. These feature models have been implemented through constraint programs, and Constraint Programming techniques based on optimized and non-optimized searches are used to automate the selection and generation of configurations. In order to compare the results of the determination of configuration a comparative analysis is given. Conclusion In this paper, we present innovative tools based on feature models, Constraint Programming and multi-objective techniques that enable the agile, adaptable and automatic selection and generation of security configurations in accordance with the needs of the organization. },

  abstract = {Abstract Mutation testing is a test selection criterion that relies on the assumption that test cases which can reveal artificial faults in the software are also good to reveal the real ones. It helps to expose faults which would go otherwise unnoticed. This criterion has been shown to be a promising means to deal with testing-related specificities of contemporary programming techniques such as Aspect-Oriented Programming. However, to date the few initiatives for customising mutation testing for aspect-oriented (AO) programs show either limited coverage with respect to the range of simulated faults, or a need for both adequate tool support and proper evaluation in regard to properties like application cost and effectiveness. This article tackles these limitations by describing a comprehensive mutation-based testing approach for programs written in AspectJ, which represents the most investigated {\{}AO{\}} programming language to date. The approach encompasses the definition of a set of mutation operators for AspectJ-specific constructs and the implementation of a tool that automates the approach. The results of a preliminary evaluation study show that the mutation operators are able to simulate faults that may not be revealed by pre-existing, non-mutation-based test suites. The results also suggest that the approach seems not to overwhelm the testers and hence represents a step towards the practical fault-based testing of AspectJ-like programs. },

  abstract = {AbstractContext Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) has emerged as a very promising approach to cope with the inherent complexity of modern software-based systems. Furthermore, it is well known that the Requirements Engineering (RE) stage is critical for a project's success. Despite the importance of RE, {\{}MDSD{\}} approaches commonly leave textual requirements specifications to one side. Objective Our aim is to integrate textual requirements specifications into the {\{}MDSD{\}} approach by using the {\{}MDSD{\}} techniques themselves, including metamodelling and model transformations. The proposal is based on the assumption that a reuse-based Model-Driven Requirements Engineering (MDRE) approach will improve the requirements engineering stage, the quality of the development models generated from requirements models, and will enable the traces from requirements to other development concepts (such as analysis or design) to be maintained. Method The approach revolves around the Requirements Engineering Metamodel, denominated as REMM, which supports the definition of the boilerplate based textual requirements specification languages needed for the definition of model transformation from application requirements models to platform-specific application models and code. Results The approach has been evaluated through its application to Home Automation (HA) systems. The {\{}HA{\}} Requirement Specification Language denominated as {\{}HAREL{\}} is used to define application requirements models which will be automatically transformed and traced to the application model conforming to the {\{}HA{\}} Domain Specific Language. Conclusions An anonymous online survey has been conducted to evaluate the degree of acceptance by both {\{}HA{\}} application developers and {\{}MDSD{\}} practitioners. The main conclusion is that 66.7{\%} of the {\{}HA{\}} experts polled strongly agree that the automatic transformation of the requirements models to {\{}HA{\}} models improves the quality of the {\{}HA{\}} models. Moreover, 58.3{\%} of the {\{}HA{\}} participants strongly agree with the usefulness of the traceability matrix which links requirements to {\{}HA{\}} functional units in order to discover which devices are related to a specific requirement. We can conclude that the experts we have consulted agree with the proposal we are presenting here, since the average mark given is 4 out of 5. },

  abstract = {Context
The paper addresses the use of a Software Product Line approach in the context of developing software for a high-integrity, regulated domain such as civil aerospace. The success of a Software Product Line approach must be judged on whether useful products can be developed more effectively (lower cost, reduced schedule) than with traditional single-system approaches. When developing products for regulated domains, the usefulness of the product is critically dependent on the ability of the development process to provide approval evidence for scrutiny by the regulating authority.
Objective
The objective of the work described is to propose a framework for arguing that a product instantiated using a Software Product Line approach can be approved and used within a regulated domain, such that the development cost of that product would be less than if it had been developed in isolation.
Method
The paper identifies and surveys the issues relating the adoption of Software Product Lines as currently understood (including related technologies such as feature modelling, component-based development and model transformation) when applied to high-integrity software development. We develop an argument framework using Goal Structuring Notation to structure the claims made and the evidence required to support the approval of an instantiated product in such domains. Any unsubstantiated claims or missing/sub-standard evidence is identified, and we propose potential approaches or pose research questions to help address this.
Results
The paper provides an argument framework supporting the use of a Software Product Line approach within a high-integrity regulated domain. It shows how lifecycle evidence can be collected, managed and used to credibly support a regulatory approval process, and provides a detailed example showing how claims regarding model transformation may be supported. Any attempt to use a Software Product Line approach in a regulated domain will need to provide evidence to support their approach in accordance with the argument outlined in the paper.
Conclusion
Product Line practices may complicate the generation of convincing evidence for approval of instantiated products, but it is possible to define a credible Trusted Product Line approach.},

In the past two decades, Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) has emerged as a distinguishable approach in software engineering, and it has attracted the attention of many researchers, which has led to many results being published in the research literature. There is a huge amount of knowledge encapsulated in conferences and journals targeting this area, but a systematic analysis of that knowledge is missing. For this reason, we aim to investigate the state-of-the-art of the {\{}CBSE{\}} area through a detailed literature review. To do this, 1231 studies dating from 1984 to 2012 were analyzed. Using the available evidence, this paper addresses five dimensions of CBSE: main objectives, research topics, application domains, research intensity and applied research methods. The main objectives found were to increase productivity, save costs and improve quality. The most addressed application domains are homogeneously divided between commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), distributed and embedded systems. Intensity of research showed a considerable increase in the last fourteen years. In addition to the analysis, this paper also synthesizes the available evidence, identifies open issues and points out areas that call for further research. },

  abstract = {Abstract Typed models of connector/component composition specify interfaces describing ports of components and connectors. Typing ensures that these ports are plugged together appropriately, so that data can flow out of each output port and into an input port. These interfaces typically consider the direction of data flow and the type of values flowing. Components, connectors, and systems are often parameterised in such a way that the parameters affect the interfaces. Typing such connector families is challenging. This paper takes a first step towards addressing this problem by presenting a calculus of connector families with integer and boolean parameters. The calculus is based on monoidal categories, with a dependent type system that describes the parameterised interfaces of these connectors. We use families of Reo connectors as running examples, and show how this calculus can be applied to Petri Nets and to {\{}BIP{\}} systems. The paper focuses on the structure of connectorsâwell-connectednessâand less on their behaviour, making it easily applicable to a wide range of coordination and component-based models. A type-checking algorithm based on constraints is used to analyse connector families, supported by a proof-of-concept implementation. },

  abstract = {Software product lines have become a successful but challenging approach to software reuse. Some of the problems that hinder the adoption of this development paradigm are the conceptual gap between the variability and design models, as well as the complexity of the traceability management between them. Most current development methods use UML stereotypes or modify UML to face variability and traceability issues. Commercial tools focus mainly on code management, at a fine-grained level. However, the use of specialized techniques and tools represent additional barriers for the widespread introduction of product lines in software companies. In this paper, we propose an alternative based on the UML package merge mechanisms to reflect the structure of the variability models in product line package architecture, thus making the traceability of the configuration decisions straightforward. This package architecture and the configuration of the concrete products are automatically generated (using Model Driven Engineering techniques) from the variability models. As an additional advantage, the package merge mechanism can be directly implemented at code level using partial classes (present in languages such as C{\#}). To support the proposal, we have developed a tool incorporated into MS Visual Studio. This tool permits the product line variability to be modeled and the required transformations to be automated, including the final compilation of concrete products. A case study of a successful experience is described in the article as an example of applying these techniques and tools. The proposed approach, a combination of UML techniques and conventional IDE tools, can make the development of product lines easier for an organization as it removes the need for specialized tools and personnel. {\textcopyright} J.UCS.},

  abstract = {Abstract Goal-driven self-optimization through feedback loops has shown effectiveness in reducing oscillating utilities due to a large number of uncertain factors in the runtime environments. However, such self-optimization is less satisfactory when there contains uncertainty in the predefined requirements goal models, such as imprecise contributions and unknown quality preferences, or during the switches of goal solutions, such as lack of understanding about the time for the adaptation actions to take effect. In this paper, we propose to handle such uncertainty in goal-driven self-optimization without interrupting the services. Taking the monitored quality values as the feedback, and the estimated earned value as the global indicator of self-optimization, our approach dynamically updates the quantitative contributions from alternative functionalities to quality requirements, tunes the preferences of relevant quality requirements, and determines a proper timing delay for the last adaptation action to take effect. After applying these runtime measures to limit the negative effect of the uncertainty in goal models and their suggested switches, an experimental study on a real-life online shopping system shows the improvements over goal-driven self-optimization approaches without uncertainty handling. },

  abstract = {Sustainable living, ie, living within the bounds of the available environmental, social, and economic resources, is the focus of many present-day social and scientific discussions. But what does sustainability mean within the context of software engineering? In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of 8 case studies to address this question within the context of a specific software engineering approach, software product line engineering (SPLE). We identify the sustainability-related characteristics that arise in present-day studies that apply SPLE. We conclude that technical and economic sustainability are in prime focus on the present SPLE practice, with social sustainability issues, where they relate to organisations, also addressed to a good degree. On the other hand, the issues related to the personal sustainability are less prominent, and environmental considerations are nearly completely amiss. We present feature models and cross-relations that result from our analysis as a starting point for sustainability engineering through SPLE, suggesting that any new development should consider how these models would be instantiated and expanded for the intended sociotechnical system. The good representation of sustainability features in these models is also validated with 2 additional case studies. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Software systems are seen more and more as evolutive systems. At the design phase, software is constantly in adaptation by the building process itself, and at runtime, it can be adapted in response to changing conditions in the executing environment such as location or resources. Adaptation is generally difficult to specify because of its cross-cutting impact on software. This article introduces an approach to unify adaptation at design and at runtime based on Aspect Oriented Modeling. Our approach proposes a unified aspect metamodel and a platform that realizes two different weaving processes to achieve design and runtime adaptations. This approach is used in a Dynamic Software Product Line which derives products that can be configured at design time and adapted at runtime in order to dynamically fit new requirements or resource changes. Such products are implemented using the Service Component Architecture and Java. Finally, we illustrate the use of our approach based on an adaptive e-shopping scenario. The main advantages of this unification are: a clear separation of concerns, the self-contained aspect model that can be weaved during the design and execution, and the platform independence guaranteed by two different types of weaving. },

Assuring the reliability of exception handling code in aspect-oriented (AO) systems is a challenging task. Testing the exception handling code is inherently difficult, since it is tricky to provoke all exceptions during tests, and the large number of different exceptions that can happen in a system may lead to the test-case explosion problem. Moreover, we have observed that some properties of {\{}AO{\}} programming (e.g., quantification, obliviousness) may conflict with characteristics of exception handling mechanisms, exacerbating existing problems (e.g., uncaught exceptions). The lack of verification approaches for exception handling code in {\{}AO{\}} systems stimulated the present work. This work presents a verification approach based on a static analysis tool, called SAFE, to check the reliability of exception handling code in AspectJ programs. We evaluated the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach in two complementary ways (i) by investigating if the {\{}SAFE{\}} tool is precise enough to uncover exception flow information and (ii) by applying the approach to three medium-sized ApectJ systems from different application domains. },

  abstract = {Context
Software documentation is an integral part of any software development process. However, software practitioners are often concerned about the value, degree of usage and usefulness of documentation during development and maintenance.
Objective
Motivated by the needs of NovAtel Inc. (NovAtel), a world-leading company developing software systems in support of global navigation satellite systems, and based on the results of a former systematic mapping study, we aimed at better understanding of the usage and the usefulness of various technical documents during software development and maintenance.
Method
We utilized the results of a former systematic mapping study and performed an industrial case study at NovAtel. From the joint definition of the analysis goals, the research method incorporates qualitative and quantitative analysis of 55 documents (design, test and process related) and 1630 of their revisions. In addition, we conducted a survey on the usage and usefulness of documents. A total of 25 staff members from the industrial partner, all having a medium to high level of experience, participated in the survey.
Results
In the context of the case study, a number of findings were derived. They include that (1) technical documentation was consulted least frequently for maintenance purpose and most frequently as an information source for development, (2) source code was considered most frequently as the preferred information source during software maintenance, (3) there is no significant difference between the usage of various documentation types during both development and maintenance, and (4) initial hypotheses stating that up-to-date information, accuracy and preciseness have the highest impact on usefulness of technical documentation.
Conclusions
It is concluded that the usage of documentation differs for various purposes and it depends on the type of the information needs as well as the tasks to be completed (e.g., development and maintenance). The results have been confirmed to be helpful for the company under study, and the firm is currently implementing some of the recommendations given.},

  abstract = {Abstract User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves validating software in a real setting by the intended audience. The aim is not so much to check the defined requirements but to ensure that the software satisfies the customer's needs. Agile methodologies put stringent demands on UAT, if only for the frequency at which it needs to be conducted due to the iterative development of small product releases. In this setting, traditional in-person meetings might not scale up well. Complementary ways are needed to reduce the costs of developer-customer collaboration during UAT. This work introduces a wiki-based approach where customers and developers asynchronously collaborate: developers set the {\{}UAT{\}} scaffolding that will later shepherd customers when testing. To facilitate understanding, mind maps are used to represent {\{}UAT{\}} sessions. To facilitate engagement, a popular mind map editor, FreeMind, is turned into an editor for FitNesse, the wiki engine in which these ideas are borne out. The approach is evaluated through a case study involving three real customers. First evaluations are promising. Though at different levels of completeness, the three customers were able to complete a UAT. Customers valued asynchronicity, mind map structuredness, and the transparent generation of documentation out of the {\{}UAT{\}} session. },

  abstract = {Abstract Information systems are widely used in all business areas. These systems typically integrate a set of functionalities that implement business rules and maintain databases. Users interact with these systems and use these features through user interfaces (UI). Each {\{}UI{\}} is usually composed of menus where the user can select the desired functionality, thus accessing a new {\{}UI{\}} that corresponds to the desired feature. Hence, a system normally contains multiple UIs. However, keeping consistency between these {\{}UIs{\}} of a system from a visual (organisation, component style, etc.) and behavioral perspective is usually difficult. This problem also appears in software production lines, where it would be desirable to have patterns to guide the construction and maintenance of UIs. One possible way of defining such patterns is to use model-driven engineering (MDE). In MDE, models are defined at different levels, where the bottom level is called a metamodel. The metamodel determines the main characteristics of the models of the upper levels, serving as a guideline. Each new level must adhere to the rules defined by the lower levels. This way, if anything changes in a lower level, these changes are propagated to the levels above it. The goal of this work is to define and validate a metamodel that allows the modeling of {\{}UIs{\}} of software systems, thus allowing the definition of patterns of interface and supporting system evolution. To build this metamodel, we use a graph structure. This choice is due to the fact that a {\{}UI{\}} can be easily represented as a graph, where each {\{}UI{\}} component is a vertex and edges represent dependencies between these components. Moreover, graph theory provides support for a great number of operations and transformations that can be useful for UIs. The metamodel was defined based on the investigation of patterns that occur in UIs. We used a sample of information systems containing different types of {\{}UIs{\}} to obtain such patterns. To validate the metamodel, we built the complete {\{}UI{\}} models of one new system and of four existing real systems. This shows not only the expressive power of the metamodel, but also its versatility, since our validation was conducted using different types of systems (a desktop system, a web system, mobile system, and a multiplatform system). Moreover, it also demonstrated that the proposed approach can be used not only to build new models, but also to describe existing ones (by reverse engineering). },

Preferences have priorities, meaning that a low priority preference can be neglected in favor of a higher prioritized one. We present a reconfiguration engine checking the validity of the current configuration and, if necessary, reconfiguring the SPL while trying to fulfill the preferences of the active user profile. Thus, users can be assured about the reconfiguration engine providing the most suitable configuration for them. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a case study based on existing car customizability. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

  abstract  = {Context: Software product lines (SPLs) and Agile are approaches that share similar objectives. The main difference is the way in which these objectives are met. Typically evidence on what activities of Agile and SPL can be combined and how they can be integrated stems from different research methods performed separately. The generalizability of this evidence is low, as the research topic is still relatively new and previous studies have been conducted using only one research method. Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of Agile SPL and improve the generalizability of the identified evidence through the use of a multi-method approach. Method: Our multi-method research combines three complementary methods (Mapping Study, Case Study and Expert Opinion) to consolidate the evidence. Results: This combination results in 23 findings that provide evidence on how Agile and SPL could be combined. Conclusion: Although multi-method research is time consuming and requires a high degree of effort to plan, design, and perform, it helps to increase the understanding on Agile SPL and leads to more generalizable evidence. The findings confirm a synergy between Agile and SPL and serve to improve the body of evidence in Agile SPL. When researchers and practitioners develop new Agile SPL approaches, it will be important to consider these synergies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Three different approaches to reuse of metamodels are analyzed. One of the approaches uses traditional object-oriented techniques. Two other approaches use aspect-oriented techniques.

In order to realize different customer projects a tool set is needed to add functions to a common software basis. The resulting software variants, which consist of modules arranged by the costumer, are key drivers for the selection of the microcontrollers used in the system designs. Each software module has real-time requirements that must be fulfilled for the whole system to work properly. Violations of these real-time requirements should become visible during requirements analysis to avoid expensive redesigns. The state of practice is to oversize the target hardware based on experience in order to minimize the risk that not all requirements can be fulfilled with the chosen hardware. In this paper, we show how a combination of timed automata analysis and variant management supports consistency during the development process and guarantees compliance with real-time requirements.},

  abstract = {Context Modern middleware platforms provide the applications deployed on top of them with facilities for their adaptation. However, the level of adaptation support provided by the state-of-the-art middleware solutions is often limited to dynamically loading and off-loading of software components. Therefore, it is left to the application developers to handle the details of change such that the system's consistency is not jeopardized. Objective We aim to change the status quo by providing the middleware facilities necessary to ensure the consistency of software after adaptation. We would like these facilities to be reusable across different applications, such that the middleware can streamline the process of achieving safe adaptation. Method Our approach addresses the current shortcomings by utilizing the information encoded in a software system's architectural style. This information drives the development of reusable adaptation patterns. The patterns specify both the exact sequence of changes and the time at which those changes need to occur. We use the patterns to provide advanced adaptation support on top of an existing architectural middleware platform. Results Our experience shows the feasibility of deriving detailed adaptation patterns for several architectural styles. Applying the middleware to adapt two real-world software systems shows the approach is effective in consistently adapting these systems without jeopardizing their consistency. Conclusion We conclude the approach is effective in alleviating the application developers from the responsibility of managing the adaptation process at the application-level. Moreover, we believe this study provides the foundation for changing the way adaptation support is realized in middleware solutions. },

  abstract = {Domain analysis enables identifying families of applications and capturing their terminology in order to assist and guide system developers to design valid applications in the domain. One major way of carrying out the domain analysis is modeling. Several studies suggest using metamodeling techniques, feature-oriented approaches, or architectural-based methods for modeling domains and specifying applications in those domains. However, these methods mainly focus on representing the domain knowledge, providing insufficient guidelines (if any) for creating application models that satisfy the domain rules and constraints. In particular, validation of the application models which include application-specific knowledge is insufficiently dealt. In order to fill these lacks, we propose a general approach, called Application-based {\{}DOmain{\}} Modeling (ADOM), which enables specifying domains and applications similarly, (re)using domain knowledge in application models, and validating the application models against the relevant domain models. In this paper we present the {\{}ADOM{\}} approach, demonstrating its application to {\{}UML{\}} 2.0 class and sequence diagrams. },

  abstract = {Variants of the finite state machine (FSM) model have been extensively used to describe the behaviour of reactive systems. In particular, several model-based testing techniques have been developed to support test case generation and test case executions from FSMs. Most such techniques require several validation properties to hold for the underlying test models. In this paper, we propose an extension of the FSM test model for software product lines (SPLs), named featured finite state machine (FFSM). As the first step towards using FFSMs as test models, we define feature-oriented variants of basic test model validation criteria. We show how the high-level validation properties coincide with the necessary properties on the product FSMs. Moreover, we provide a mechanised tool prototype for checking the feature-oriented properties using satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solver tools. We investigate the applicability of our approach by applying it to both randomly generated FFSMs as well as those from a realistic case study (the Body Comfort System). The results of our study show that for random FFSMs over 16 independent non-mandatory features, our technique provides substantial efficiency gains for the set of proposed validity checks. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  abstract = {Context
Software architectures should be evaluated during the early stages of software development in order to verify whether the non-functional requirements (NFRs) of the product can be fulfilled. This activity is even more crucial in software product line (SPL) development, since it is also necessary to identify whether the NFRs of a particular product can be achieved by exercising the variation mechanisms provided by the product line architecture or whether additional transformations are required. These issues have motivated us to propose QuaDAI, a method for the derivation, evaluation and improvement of software architectures in model-driven SPL development.
Objective
We present in this paper the results of a family of four experiments carried out to empirically validate the evaluation and improvement strategy of QuaDAI.
Method
The family of experiments was carried out by 92 participants: Computer Science Master's and undergraduate students from Spain and Italy. The goal was to compare the effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and intention to use with regard to participants using the evaluation and improvement strategy of QuaDAI as opposed to the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM).
Results
The main result was that the participants produced their best results when applying QuaDAI, signifying that the participants obtained architectures with better values for the NFRs faster, and that they found the method easier to use, more useful and more likely to be used. The results of the meta-analysis carried out to aggregate the results obtained in the individual experiments also confirmed these results.
Conclusions
The results support the hypothesis that QuaDAI would achieve better results than ATAM in the experiments and that QuaDAI can be considered as a promising approach with which to perform architectural evaluations that occur after the product architecture derivation in model-driven SPL development processes when carried out by novice software evaluators.},

In this case, goal models serve as input for designing business process models. This requires mappings between both types of models in order to describe which user goals are implemented by which activities in a business process. Due to the large number of possible relationships among goals in the goal model and possible control flows of activities, developers struggle with the challenge of maintaining consistent configurations of both models and their mappings. Managing these mappings manually is error-prone. In our work, we propose an automated solution that relies on Description Logics and automated reasoners for validating mappings that describe the realization of goals by activities in business process models. The results are the identification of two inconsistency patterns â orchestration inconsistency and choreography inconsistency â and the development of the corresponding algorithms for detecting these inconsistencies. },

  abstract = {Fast-changing hardware and software technologies in addition to larger and more specialized customer bases demand software tailored to meet very diverse requirements. Software development approaches that aim at capturing this diversity on a single consolidated platform often require large upfront investments, e.g., time or budget. Alternatively, companies resort to developing one variant of a software product at a time by reusing as much as possible from already-existing product variants. However, identifying and extracting the parts to reuse is an error-prone and inefficient task compounded by the typically large number of product variants. Hence, more disciplined and systematic approaches are needed to cope with the complexity of developing and maintaining sets of product variants. Such approaches require detailed information about the product variants, the features they provide and their relations. In this paper, we present an approach to extract such variability information from product variants. It identifies traces from features and feature interactions to their implementation artifacts, and computes their dependencies. This work can be useful in many scenarios ranging from ad hoc development approaches such as clone-and-own to systematic reuse approaches such as software product lines. We applied our variability extraction approach to six case studies and provide a detailed evaluation. The results show that the extracted variability information is consistent with the variability in our six case study systems given by their variability models and available product variants. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s).},

Variability not only affects functionality, but also quality attributes (e.g., security, performance). Service-based software systems consider variability in functionality implicitly by dynamic service composition. However, variability in quality attributes of service-based systems seems insufficiently addressed in current design practices. Objective We aim at (a) assessing methods for handling variability in quality attributes of service-based systems, (b) collecting evidence about current research that suggests implications for practice, and (c) identifying open problems and areas for improvement. Method A systematic literature review with an automated search was conducted. The review included studies published between the year 2000 and 2011. We identified 46 relevant studies. Results Current methods focus on a few quality attributes, in particular performance and availability. Also, most methods use formal techniques. Furthermore, current studies do not provide enough evidence for practitioners to adopt proposed approaches. So far, variability in quality attributes has mainly been studied in laboratory settings rather than in industrial environments. Conclusions The product line domain as the domain that traditionally deals with variability has only little impact on handling variability in quality attributes. The lack of tool support, the lack of practical research and evidence for the applicability of approaches to handle variability are obstacles for practitioners to adopt methods. Therefore, we suggest studies in industry (e.g., surveys) to collect data on how practitioners handle variability of quality attributes in service-based systems. For example, results of our study help formulate hypotheses and questions for such surveys. Based on needs in practice, new approaches can be proposed. },

  abstract = {Context Software ecosystems are increasingly popular for their economic, strategic, and technical advantages. Application platforms such as Android or iOS allow users to highly customize a system by selecting desired functionality from a large variety of assets. This customization is achieved using variability mechanisms. Objective Variability mechanisms are well-researched in the context of software product lines. Although software ecosystems are often seen as conceptual successors, the technology that sustains their success and growth is much less understood. Our objective is to improve empirical understanding of variability mechanisms used in successful software ecosystems. Method We analyze five ecosystems, ranging from the Linux kernel through Eclipse to Android. A qualitative analysis identifies and characterizes variability mechanisms together with their organizational context. This analysis leads to a conceptual framework that unifies ecosystem-specific aspects using a common terminology. A quantitative analysis investigates scales, growth rates, and - most importantly - dependency structures of the ecosystems. Results In all the studied ecosystems, we identify rich dependency languages and variability descriptions that declare many direct and indirect dependencies. Indirect dependencies to abstract capabilities, as opposed to concrete variability units, are used predominantly in fast-growing ecosystems. We also find that variability models - while providing system-wide abstractions over code - work best in centralized variability management and are, thus, absent in ecosystems with large free markets. These latter ecosystems tend to emphasize maintaining capabilities and common vocabularies, dynamic discovery, and binding with strong encapsulation of contributions, together with uniform distribution channels. Conclusion The use of specialized mechanisms in software ecosystems with large free markets, as opposed to software product lines, calls for recognition of a new discipline - variability encouragement. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Context: Quality attributes play a critical role in the architecture elicitation phase. Software Sustainability and energy efficiency is becoming a critical quality attribute that can be used as a selection criteria to choose from among different design or implementation alternatives. Energy efficiency usually competes with other non-functional requirements, like for instance, performance. Objective: This paper presents a process that helps developers to automatically generate optimum configurations of functional quality attributes in terms of energy efficiency and performance. Functional quality attributes refer to the behavioral properties that need to be incorporated inside a software architecture to fulfill a particular quality attribute (e.g., encryption and authentication for the security quality attribute, logging for the usability quality attribute). Method: Quality attributes are characterized to identify their design and implementation variants and how the different configurations influence both energy efficiency and performance. A usage model for each characterized quality attribute is defined. The variability of quality attributes, as well as the energy efficiency and performance experiment results, are represented as a constraint satisfaction problem with the goal of formally reasoning about it. Then, a configuration of the selected functional quality attributes is automatically generated, which is optimum with respect to a selected objective function. Results: Software developers can improve the energy efficiency and/or performance of their applications by using our approach to perform a richer analysis of the energy consumption and performance of different alternatives for functional quality attributes. We show quantitative values of the benefits of using our approach and discuss the threats to validity. Conclusions: The process presented in this paper will help software developers to build more energy efficient software, whilst also being aware of how their decisions affect other quality attributes, such as performance. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors},

  abstract = {Product line engineering is a promising discipline for developing a family of systems based on a reusable asset base by systematically managing variability. Requirements tools that deal with variability are a key in the development of product lines. Because of the weak tool support to reuse system requirements and heterogeneity in the representations and processes, we identify a need for guidance and empirical evidence in order to extend a requirements tool with variability. We believe that existing requirement tools can be reused for product line requirements engineering (RE) by adding plug-ins. In this paper, we report a retrospective multiple case study with two diverse cases on developing and deploying variability plug-ins. Our study is based on the theory building process from social sciences and organizational theory. We show how our results can be used by practitioners to extend an RE tool with minimal implementation effort to manage variability.},

  abstract = {Reuse, enabled by modularity and interfaces, is one of the most important concepts in software engineering. This is evidenced by an increasingly large number of reusable artifacts, ranging from small units such as classes to larger, more sophisticated units such as components, services, frameworks, software product lines, and concerns. This paper presents evidence that a canonical set of reuse interfaces has emerged over time: the variation, customization, and usage interfaces (VCU). A reusable artifact that provides all three interfaces reaches the highest potential of reuse, as it explicitly exposes how the artifact can be manipulated during the reuse process along these three dimensions. We demonstrate the wide applicability of the VCU interfaces along two axes: across abstraction layers of a system specification and across existing reuse techniques. The former is shown with the help of a comprehensive case study including reusable requirements, software, and hardware models for the authorization domain. The latter is shown with a discussion on how the VCU interfaces relate to existing reuse techniques. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

However, the lack of a formal semantics and reasoning support of feature models has hindered the development of this area. Industrial experiences also show that methods and tools that can support feature model analysis are badly appreciated. Such reasoning tool should be fully automated and efficient.

To determine the possible uses of such tools in real practice, we conduct a diary study in which eleven developers in real-world developments use a novel visualization tool (a graphical code recommender) for one month. In the study, we ask what information and features the visualization and diagramming tools should provide to aid developers' work according to their situations. The study reveals the situations in which developers would use such visualization and diagramming tools and also the concrete requirements for such tools that would make them useful. },

  abstract = {Context: The term software reuse was first used in 1968 at the NATO conference. Since then, work in the scientific literature has stated that the application of software reuse offers benefits such as increase in quality and productivity. Nonetheless, in spite of many publications reporting software reuse experiences, evidence that such benefits having reached industrial settings is scarce. Objective: To identify and classify the benefits transferred to real-world settings by the application of software reuse strategies. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS). Our search strategies retrieved a set of 2,413 papers out of which 49 were selected as primary studies. We defined five facets to classify these studies: (a) the type of benefit, (b) the reuse process, (c) the industry's domain, (d) the type of reuse and (e) the type of research reported. Results: Quality increase (28 papers) and Productivity increase (25 papers) were the two most mentioned benefits. Component-Based Development (CBD) was the most reported reuse strategy (41{\%}), followed by Software Product Lines (SPL, 30{\%}). The selected papers mentioned fourteen industrial domains, of which four stand out: aerospace and defense, telecommunications, electronics and IT services. The application of systematic reuse was reported in 78{\%} of the papers. Regarding the research type, 50{\%} use evaluation research as the investigation method. Finally, 13 papers (27{\%}) reported validity threats for the research method applied. Conclusions: The literature analyzed presents a lack of empirical data, making it difficult to evaluate the effective transfer of benefits to the industry. This work did not find any relationship between the reported benefits and the reuse strategy applied by the industry or the industry domain. Although the most reported research method was industrial case studies (25 works), half of these works (12) did not report threats to validity. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

But research in this domain is still very active, as deciding what information influences which application is a complex problem. The work presented in this paper focuses on the transportation domain and more particularly on applications designed to assist the user in transportation activities (e.g., driving, visiting a city, ...). As multiple applications should react in a similar way to the context changes, we propose a framework for their execution and context management.

Although technology itself is enabling easy management of project execution, failure can still occur, particularly with respect to an ample number of unique projects. It is argued here that the ampleness and uniqueness of projects provide criteria for such projects to be treated differently from smaller-scale enterprises of the same type. Gaps can be identified in the literature with regards to exact definitions of project success and failure. It is proposed that three main issues can impact a project's ecosystem and determine its failure, namely, uncertainty, volatility, and unknowns. Based on these aspects, future project performance can be estimated and correspondingly managed. At the same time, retrospective assessment of success or failure may be made rigorous based on exact definitions. Two case studies of major technological projects are presented and discussed here as examples of theory application. },

A trait is a set of methods that is independent from any class hierarchy and can be flexibly used to build other traits or classes by means of a suite of composition operations. In this paper we present the new version of Xtraitj, a trait-based programming language that features complete compatibility and interoperability with the Java platform. Xtraitj is implemented in Xtext and Xbase, and it provides a full Eclipse IDE that supports an incremental adoption of traits in existing Java projects. The new version of Xtraitj allows traits to be accessed from any Java project or library, even if the original Xtraitj source code is not available, since traits can be accessed in their byte-code format. This allows developers to create Xtraitj libraries that can be provided in their binary only format. We detail the technique we used to achieve such an implementation; this technique can be reused in other languages implemented in Xtext for the Java platform. We formalize our traits by means of flattening semantics and we provide some performance benchmarks that show that the runtime overhead introduced by our traits is acceptable.},

  abstract = {Abstract Enterprise Application Monitoring is an essential task to support Operations. The downsides are the high effort of data collection as well as Application Architecture documentation. While hard failures are easy to identify â an application just stop working, it is a great challenge to identify reductions in service warranty fulfillment. Especially for applications with over-fulfillment of defined Service Level [Agreements] (SLA) it can be tight to identify noteworthy reductions of performance. As a result, an Operations team has the challenge to notice a constraint while the status of an application is âgreenâ based on the SLA. From an Operations perspective it is essential to identify potential incidents as early as possible to initiate counteractions. This paper discuss based on a Case Study, how patterns can be identified to define meaningful values for the âyellowâ threshold of an application in order to support Service Management and Operation. The goal is to utilize existing data to minimize the impact to the {\{}IT{\}} infrastructure. Using existing log data from applications and monitoring solutions help to achieve this goal by limiting the additional efforts to analyzing and reporting. },

  abstract = {The Service Oriented Architecture (Soa) paradigm supports the assembly of atomic services to create applications that implement complex business processes. Since âreal-lifeâ processes can be very complex, composition mechanisms inspired by the Separation of Concerns paradigm (e.g. features, aspects) are good candidates to support the definition and the upcoming evolutions of large systems. We propose Adore, âan Activity meta-moDel supOrting oRchestration Evolutionâ to address this issue. The Adore meta-model allows process designers to express in the same formalism business processes and fragments of processes. Such fragments define additional activities that aim to be integrated into other processes and adequately support their evolution. The underlying logical foundations of Adore allow the definition of interference detection rules as logical predicate, as well as the definition of consistency properties on Adore models. Consequently, the Adore framework supports process designers while they design and then apply evolutions on large processes, managing the detection of interferences among fragments and ensuring that the composed processes are consistent and do not depend on the order of the composition. },
